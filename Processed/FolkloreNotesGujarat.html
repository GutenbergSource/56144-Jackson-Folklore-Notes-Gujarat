<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The circumstances attending the murder of Mr. A. M. T.
Jackson in Nasik in December 1909 led to the raising of a small
subscription among his friends, to be devoted to a memorial in some
shape or form, showing the respect and affection with which he was
regarded in Western India. A large part of the fund then raised was
expended on the purchase of his valuable library, which now forms a
part of the collection owned by the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic
Society. It was subsequently decided that the balance could not be
better spent than in defraying the cost of publishing certain folklore
materials which he had collected and intended, at the time of his
untimely death, to publish in the pages of the <i>Indian Antiquary</i>.
These materials were the result of an enquiry set on foot by him about
the year 1900. His plan of operation was to forward, through the agency
of the Education Department, Crooke&rsquo;s list of folklore questions
to schoolmasters in various parts of the Presidency. The question paper
is given below; the replies form the raw material from which these
notes have been compiled. For convenience they are divided into two
series: Gujarat and the Konkan.</p>
<p>I desire at the outset of these introductory remarks to explain
that, when at the request of the memorial committee I undertook the
task of seeing these notes through the press, I did not contemplate any
critical handling of the materials found in the papers made over to me.
I had neither the leisure nor the knowledge to carry out Mr.
Jackson&rsquo;s intention, <i>i.e.</i>, to edit the notes carefully
with such criticisms and comparisons as his ripe scholarship would have
suggested. I make no claim, therefore, to have effected more than to
have rescued from the wastepaper basket a number of replies to
questions regarding the beliefs of the people in Gujarat and the
Konkan. The notes as now presented doubtless contain much that is
trivial, and possibly many inaccuracies; but among them students of
folklore may on the other hand discover material of real
value&mdash;such as they are, they will, I trust, repay careful study,
and perhaps serve one day to form the basis of a further and more
comprehensive examination of the folk-lore of the Bombay
Presidency&mdash;an examination which should not be too long deferred,
for the old practices and beliefs are yearly tending to decay and
vanish in contact with the spread of education. The field for enquiry
is wide and rich, but workers fail to come forward; and meanwhile the
old beliefs and practices slowly disappear. On the subjects with which
these notes deal, much information of value has already been collected
and recorded by another oriental scholar, the late Sir James Campbell,
K.C.I.E., and will be found partly in the pages of the Bombay
Gazetteer, and partly in the notes on the Spirit Basis of Belief and
Custom which he published from time to time in the <i>Indian
Antiquary</i>. The present notes carry striking confirmation of Sir
James Campbell&rsquo;s theory regarding the extent to which beliefs and
religious practices in this country can be traced to the desire to
propitiate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e168" href="#xd26e168"
name="xd26e168">6</a>]</span>spirit presences. It may be remarked that
Campbell&rsquo;s work in the domain of Indian folk-lore does not seem
to have received the notice that it deserves in the works of writers on
folk-lore generally, possibly because so much of it is buried in the
pages of the Bombay Gazetteer or in scattered numbers of the <i>Indian
Antiquary</i>. The notes would amply repay the labour of republication,
with a summary and suitable index. They deal very fully with spirit
worship and possession, witchcraft and magic, and the evil eye. They
differ from the present notes in being to a large extent comparative,
assembling under the various heads of ancestor worship, spirit haunts,
spirit possession, exorcism, etc., kindred beliefs from all parts of
the world. Doubtless his work to no small extent suggested to Mr.
Jackson the line of enquiry which is contained in the question paper.
From the materials accumulated by these two scholars a comprehensive
study of the folk-lore of western India may one day be compiled.</p>
<p>The notes illustrate very fully the common beliefs in unseen
presences causing mischief of various kinds. They illustrate the common
methods of protection by propitiation, of spirit and disease scaring,
and of avoidance of the effects of the evil eye. A full list will be
found (pp. 126&ndash;130) of the lucky and unlucky omens besetting the
undertaking of various acts, and much information is recorded regarding
lucky and unlucky numbers, and spirit scaring names which has not, so
far as I am aware, been made public before. Ceremonies for exorcising
spirits that have possessed human beings are given in some detail.
There will also be found an account of the interpretation commonly put
on such natural phenomena as the rainbow, an eclipse, thunder,
lightning, meteors, comets, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Many examples are given of the beliefs regarding the means for
securing successful pregnancy. The trees and animals worshipped in the
country side are described, with the ceremony that is held to be
suitable in each case. An unusually interesting belief is that which
attributes to a certain lake in Gujarat the power to transform males
into females and vice versa (see p. 39). The curing of diseases by the
wearing of magic threads and the application of <i>mantras</i> or holy
verses is also dealt with in some detail. Finally a list is given of
the shrines of the country side with the tradition regarding the holy
man in whose honour and to whose memory they have been erected. They
are for the most part worshipped alike by Hindu and Musalman.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would refer once more to the fact that no attempt
has been made to edit critically the information embodied in these
notes. In the scanty leisure available after official demands on my
time have been met, it has only been possible to see the materials
through the press as they stood, after translation. The task has been
greatly lightened by the generous assistance received from R. B. P. B.
Joshi who undertook the preparation of the whole of the MSS. of the
Konkan series. I am also greatly indebted to Mr. G. M. Kalelkar for
many arduous hours of work on the compilation of the Gujarat papers. To
both these gentlemen my cordial thanks are due for their co-operation.
If the publication of these materials serve to stimulate interest in
the subject of Indian folk-lore, they will not have been printed in
vain. Such as they are, they will, I trust<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e182" title="Not in source">,</span> remain as a small tribute to
the memory of an oriental scholar, of no mean merit, of whose services
India was deprived in so untimely a manner.</p>

<p class="first">Besides the higher-grade deities, whose worship is
enjoined and treated of in the Sh&#257;stras and Pur&#257;nas, numerous
other minor deities, none of whom however find a place in the
Scriptures, are worshipped by the lower classes. The principle
underlying the whole fabric of the worship of these minor deities, who
for the most part are the spirits of dead ancestors or heroes, has more
in it of fear for their power of harming than of love for their divine
nature. All untoward occurrences in domestic affairs, all bodily
ailments and unusual natural phenomena, inexplicable to the simple mind
of the villager, are attributed to the malignant action of these
nameless and numerous spirits, hovering over and haunting the
habitations of men.<a class="noteref" id="n15.1src" href="#n15.1" name=
"n15.1src">1</a> The latent dread of receiving injuries from these evil
spirits results in the worship by the low-class people of a number of
<i>devas</i> and <i>m&#257;t&#257;s</i>, as they are called. The poor
villager, surrounded on all sides by hosts of hovering spirits, ready
to take offence, or even to possess him, on the smallest pretext,
requires some tangible protector to save him from such malign
influences.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n15.1">1</a> He sets up and
enshrines the spirit that he believes to have been beneficent to him,
and so deserving of worship, and makes vows in its honour, often
becoming himself the officiating priest. Each such deity has its own
particular <i>th&#257;nak</i> (<i>sth&#257;na</i>) or locality. Thus
there is hardly a village which has not a particular deity of its own.
But in addition to this deity, others in far off villages are generally
held in high esteem.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n15.1">1</a></p>
<p>There are a number of ways in which these lower-class deities can be
installed. Their images are made either of wood, stone, or
metal.<a class="noteref" id="n15.2src" href="#n15.2" name=
"n15.2src">2</a> No temples or shrines are erected in their
honour.<a class="noteref" id="n15.3src" href="#n15.3" name=
"n15.3src">3</a> An ordinary way of representing them is by drawing a
trident, (<i>trish&#363;l</i>, a weapon peculiar to god Shiva) in
<span class="corr" id="xd26e645" title=
"Source: red lead">red-lead</span> and oil on an upright slab of stone
on a public road, on any dead wall, on the confines of a village, or a
mountain side, or a hill top, in an underground cellar, or on the bank
of a stream.<a class="noteref" id="n15.4src" href="#n15.4" name=
"n15.4src">4</a> Some people paint tridents in their own houses. The
<i>trish&#363;l</i>, or trident, may also be made of wood, in which
case its three points are plastered with red-lead and oil and covered
with a thin coating of tin.<a class="noteref" id="n15.5src" href=
"#n15.5" name="n15.5src">5</a> Sometimes carved wooden images in human
shape, daubed over with red-lead and oil, are placed in a small wooden
chariot or in a recess about a foot square. In some shrines two brooms
or whisks of peacock&rsquo;s feathers are placed on either side of the
image.<a class="noteref" id="n15.6src" href="#n15.6" name=
"n15.6src">6</a> A slight difficulty overcome or a disease remedied by
a vow in honour of any of these deities offers the occasion for an
installation, and in all future emergencies of the same kind similar
vows are observed. A <i>m&#257;t&#257;</i> installed to protect a
fortress or a street is called a Gadheri M&#257;t&#257;, and the
worshippers of a fortress, or street, mother are known as
Pothias.<a class="noteref" id="n15.7src" href="#n15.7" name=
"n15.7src">7</a> At the time of installation flags are hoisted near the
dedicated places. A troop of dancers with jingling anklets recite holy
verses, while the <i>bhuva</i>, exorcist-priest, performs the
ceremonies. Generally installations are frequent during the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e671" href="#xd26e671" name=
"xd26e671">16</a>]</span>Navar&#257;tra<a class="noteref" id="n16.asrc"
href="#n16.a" name="n16.asrc">8</a> holidays when, if no human-shaped
image is set up, a <i>trish&#363;l</i> at least is drawn in red-lead
and oil.<a class="noteref" id="n16.1src" href="#n16.1" name=
"n16.1src">9</a> Some of these evil deities require, at the time of
their installation, the <i>balid&#257;n</i> (sacrifice or oblation) of
a goat or a he-buffalo. Also, when a spirit is to be exorcised, the
symbol of the familiar spirit of the exorcist is set up and invoked by
him.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n16.1">9</a> After the
installation, no systematic form of worship is followed in connection
with them.<a class="noteref" id="n16.2src" href="#n16.2" name=
"n16.2src">10</a> Regular forms are prescribed for the <i>real</i> gods
of the Pur&#257;nas. But upon these the low-caste people are not
authorised to attend.</p>
<p>Still, in practice there are two forms of worship: ordinary or
<i>s&#257;m&#257;nya-p&#363;j&#257;</i> and special or
<i>vishesha-p&#363;j&#257;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n16.3src" href=
"#n16.3" name="n16.3src">11</a> Ordinary worship is performed by
bathing the deity&mdash;which can be done by sprinkling a few drops of
water over it&mdash;burning a ghi, or an oil, lamp before it, and by
offering a cocoanut and a pice or a half-anna piece. The last is taken
away by the <i>bhuva</i>, or priest, who returns generally half or
three-quarters of the cocoanut as a <i>pras&#257;d</i> of the god.</p>
<p>There are no particular days prescribed for such worship, but
Sundays and Tuesdays would seem to be the most favoured.<a class=
"noteref" id="n16.4src" href="#n16.4" name="n16.4src">12</a> On such
days, offerings are made for the fulfilment of a vow recorded in order
to avoid a <i>b&#257;dh&#257;</i>, or impending evil. In the observance
of this vow the devotee abstains from certain things, such as ghi,
butter, milk, rice, juvar, betelnut till the period of the vow expires.
When a vow is thus discharged, the devotee offers flowers, garlands,
incense, food or drink according to the terms of his vow.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n16.4">12</a> The <i>dh&#363;pa</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, burning incense of <i>g&#363;gal</i> (balsamodendron) is
one of the commonest methods of worship.</p>
<p>The days for special worship are the Navar&#257;tra holidays, the
second day of the bright half of &#256;sh&#257;dh, the ninth month of
the Hindu Calendar,<a class="noteref" id="n16.5src" href="#n16.5" name=
"n16.5src">13</a> Div&#257;s&#257;<a class="noteref" id="n16.6src"
href="#n16.6" name="n16.6src">14</a> or the fifteenth day of the dark
half of &#256;sh&#257;dh, and K&#257;l&#299;-chaudas<a class="noteref"
id="n16.7src" href="#n16.7" name="n16.7src">15</a> or the fourteenth
day of the dark half of &#256;shvin, the last month; besides other
extraordinary occasions when a spirit has to be exorcised out of a sick
person.</p>
<p>The Navar&#257;tra days are said to be the most auspicious days for
dev&#299;-worship. People believing in the power of the m&#257;t&#257;s
observe fast on these days. Most of them at least fast on the eighth
day of the Navar&#257;tra known as M&#257;t&#257;-ashtam&#299;, taking
only a light meal which consists of roots, as a rule, especially the
suran (<span lang="la">Amorphophallus campanulatus</span>), and of
dates and milk.<a class="noteref" id="n16.8src" href="#n16.8" name=
"n16.8src">16</a> On the Navar&#257;tra days red-lead and oil are
applied to the images of the devis, and a number of oblations, such as
loaves, cooked rice, <i>l&#257;psi</i><a class="noteref" id="n16.bsrc"
href="#n16.b" name="n16.bsrc">17</a>, <i>vad&#257;n</i><a class=

<i>b&#257;kl&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="n16.dsrc" href="#n16.d"
name="n16.dsrc">19</a> are offered.<a class="noteref" id="n16.9src"
href="#n16.9" name="n16.9src">20</a> The utmost ceremonial cleanliness
is observed in the preparation of these viands. The corn is sifted,
cleaned, ground or pounded, cooked, treated with frankincense, offered
to the gods and lastly partaken of before sunset, and all these
operations must be performed on the same day; for the offerings must
not see lamp-light.<a class="noteref" id="n16.10src" href="#n16.10"
name="n16.10src">21</a> Girls are not allowed to partake of these
offerings. All ceremonies should be conducted with much earnestness and
reverence; otherwise the offerings will fail to prove acceptable to the
m&#257;t&#257;s or devis.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n16.10">21</a></p>
<p>On M&#257;t&#257;-ashtam&#299; and K&#257;l&#299;-chaudas devotees
sometimes offer rams, goats or buffaloes as victims to the devis or
devas in addition to the usual offerings of <i>l&#257;psi</i>,
<i>vad&#257;n</i> and <i>b&#257;kl&#257;</i>.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n16.10">21</a> The night of K&#257;l&#299;-chaudas is believed
to be so favourable for the efficacious <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e796" href="#xd26e796" name="xd26e796">17</a>]</span>recitation
(<i>s&#257;dhana</i>) of certain <i>mantras</i>, mysterious
incantations possessing sway over spirits, that <i>bhuvas</i>
(exorcists) leave the village and sit up performing certain rites in
<span class="corr" id="xd26e808" title=
"Source: cometeries">cemeteries</span>, on burning-ghats, and in other
equally suitable places where spirits are supposed to
congregate.<a class="noteref" id="n17.1src" href="#n17.1" name=
"n17.1src">22</a></p>
<p>On Div&#257;s&#257;, the last day of &#256;sh&#257;dh, the ninth
month, low-caste people bathe their gods with water and milk, besmear
them with red-lead and oil, and make offerings of cocoanuts,
<i>l&#257;psi</i>, <i>b&#257;kl&#257;</i> of <i>ad&#257;d</i>
(<span class="corr" id="xd26e825" title=
"Source: Phansolens">Phaseoleus</span> radiatus) or
<i>kans&#257;r</i><a class="noteref" id="n17.asrc" href="#n17.a" name=
"n17.asrc">23</a>. Particular offerings are believed to be favoured by
particular deities: for instance, <i>khichdo</i> (rice and pulse boiled
together) and oil, or <i>tavo</i> (flat unleavened loaves) are favoured
by the goddess Meldi, boiled rice by Shikotar and <i>l&#257;psi</i> by
the goddess G&#257;tr&#257;d.<a class="noteref" id="n17.2src" href=
"#n17.2" name="n17.2src">24</a></p>
<p>On these holidays, as well as on the second day of the bright half
of &#256;sh&#257;dh the devotees hoist flags in honour of the spirits,
and play on certain musical instruments producing discordant sounds.
Meanwhile <i>bhuvas</i>, believed to be interpreters of the wills of
evil spirits, undergo self-torture, with the firm conviction that the
spirits have entered their persons. Sometimes they lash themselves with
iron chains or cotton braided scourges.<a class="noteref" id="n17.3src"
href="#n17.3" name="n17.3src">25</a> At times a <i>bhuva</i> places a
pan-full of sweet oil over a fire till it boils. He then fries cakes in
it, and takes them out with his unprotected hands, sprinkling the
boiling oil over his hair. He further dips thick cotton wicks into the
oil, lights them and puts them into his mouth and throws red-hot
bullets into his mouth, seemingly without any injury.<a class="noteref"
id="n17.4src" href="#n17.4" name="n17.4src">26</a> This process secures
the confidence of the <i>sevakas</i> or followers, and is very often
used by <i>bhuvas</i> when exorcising spirits from persons whose
confidence the <i>bhuvas</i> wish to gain. A bowl-full of water is then
passed round the head of the ailing person (or animal) to be charmed,
and the contents are swallowed by the exorcist to show that he has
swallowed in the water all the ills the flesh of the patient is heir
to.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n17.4">26</a></p>
<p>In the cure of certain diseases by exorcising the process known as
<i>ut&#257;r</i> is sometimes gone through. An <i>ut&#257;r</i> is a
sacrificial offering of the nature of a scapegoat, and consists of a
black earthen vessel, open and broad at the top, and containing
<i>l&#257;psi</i>, <i>vad&#257;n</i>, <i>b&#257;kl&#257;</i>, a yard of
<i>atlas</i> (dark-red silk fabric), one rupee and four annas in cash,
pieces of charcoal, red-lead, <i>sorro</i> (or surmo-lead ore used as
eye-powder), an iron-nail and three cocoanuts.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n17.4">26</a> Very often a trident is drawn in red-lead and oil
on the outer sides of the black earthen vessel.<a class="noteref" id=
"n17.5src" href="#n17.5" name="n17.5src">27</a> The <i>bhuva</i>
carries the <i>ut&#257;r</i> in his hands with a drawn sword in a
procession, to the noise of the jingling of the anklets of his
companions, the beating of drums and the rattling of cymbals. After
placing the <i>ut&#257;r</i> in the cemetery the procession returns
with tumultuous shouts of joy and much jingling of anklets.<a class=
"noteref" id="n17.6src" href="#n17.6" name="n17.6src">28</a></p>
<p>Sometimes <i>bhuvas</i> are summoned for two or three nights
preceding the day of the <i>ut&#257;r</i> ceremony, and a ceremony
known as <i>D&#257;nkl&#257;n-besw&#257;n</i> or the installation of
the <i>d&#257;nkl&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="n17.7src" href=
"#n17.7" name="n17.7src">29</a> is performed. (A
<i>d&#257;nkl&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="n17.bsrc" href="#n17.b"
name="n17.bsrc">30</a> is a special spirit instrument in the shape of a
small kettle-drum producing, when beaten by a stick, a most discordant,
and, by long association, a melancholy, gruesome and ghastly
sound&mdash;K. B. Fazlullah).</p>
<p>Many sects have special deities of their own, attended upon by a
<i>bhuva</i> of the same order.<a class="noteref" id="n17.8src" href=
"#n17.8" name="n17.8src">31</a> The <i>bhuva</i> holds a high position
in the society of his caste-fellows. He believes himself to be
possessed by the devi or m&#257;t&#257; whose attendant he is, and
declares, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e956" href="#xd26e956"

<p>The following is a list of some of the inferior local deities of
Gujarat and Kathiawar:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Suro-p&#363;ro.&mdash;This is generally the spirit of some brave
ancestor who died a heroic death, and is worshipped by his descendants
as a family-god at his birthplace as well as at the scene of his death,
where a pillar (<i>p&#257;lio</i>) is erected to his memory.<a class=
"noteref" id="n18.3src" href="#n18.3" name="n18.3src">34</a></p>
<p>(2) Vachhro, otherwise known by the name of D&#257;d&#257;
(sire).&mdash;This is said to have been a Rajput, killed in rescuing
the cowherds of some Ch&#257;rans, who invoked his aid, from a party of
free-booters.<a class="noteref" id="n18.4src" href="#n18.4" name=
"n18.4src">35</a> He is considered to be the family-god of the Ahirs of
Solanki descent, and is the sole village-deity in Okha and Baradi
Districts.<a class="noteref" id="n18.5src" href="#n18.5" name=
"n18.5src">36</a> Other places dedicated to this god are
Pad&#257;n&#257;, Ani&#257;l&#257;, Taluka Mengani,<a class="noteref"

Khirasar&#257; and Anida.<a class="noteref" id="n18.7src" href="#n18.7"

Ch&#257;rans perform priestly duties in front of him.<a class="noteref"

<p>(3) Sarm&#257;lio commands worship in Gondal, Khokh&#257;ri and many
other places. Newly-married couples of many castes loosen the knots
tied in their marriage-scarves as a mark of respect for him.<a class=
"noteref" id="n18.asrc" href="#n18.a" name="n18.asrc">41</a> Persons

the cure of small-pox.&mdash;Persons attacked by this disease observe
vows in her honour. K&#257;l&#257;vad and Sy&#257;dl&#257; are places
dedicated to her.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n18.9">40</a></p>
<p>(5) Gan&#257;gor.&mdash;Virgins who are anxious to secure suitable
husbands and comfortable establishments worship this goddess and
observe vows in her honour.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n18.9">40</a></p>
<p>(6) Tod&#257;li&#257;<span class="corr" id="xd26e1022" title=
"Not in source">.</span>&mdash;She has neither an idol nor a temple set
up in her honour, but is represented by a heap of stones lying on the
village boundary&mdash;P&#257;dal or J&#257;mp&#257;. All marriage
processions, before entering the village (S&#257;nk&#257;) or passing
by the heap, pay homage to this deity and offer a cocoanut, failure to
do which is believed to arouse her wrath. She does not command daily
adoration, but on occasions the attendant, who is a Chumv&#257;li&#257;
Koli, and who appropriates all the presents to this deity, burns
frankincense of <i>gugal</i> (balsamodendron) and lights a lamp before
her.<a class="noteref" id="n18.10src" href="#n18.10" name=
"n18.10src">42</a></p>
<p>(7) Butt&#257;ya also is represented by a heap of stones on a
hillock in the vicinity of S&#257;nk&#257;. Her worshipper is a
Talabdia Koli. A long season of drought leads to her propitiation by
feasting Br&#257;hmans, for which purpose four pounds of corn are taken
in her name from each threshing floor in the village.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n18.10">42</a></p>
<p>(8) Surdhan.&mdash;This seems to have been some brave Kshatriya
warrior who died on a battlefield. A temple is erected to his memory,
containing an image of Shiva. The attending priest is an Atit.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n18.10">42</a></p>
<p>(9) Ghogho.&mdash;This is a cobra-god worshipped in the village of
Bikhijada having a Bajana (tumbler) for his attending priest.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n18.10">42</a></p>
<p>(10) Pir.&mdash;This is a Musalman saint, in whose honour no tomb is
erected, the special site alone being worshipped by a devotee.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n18.10">42</a></p>
<p>(11) Raneki is represented by a heap of stones, and is attended upon
by <i>cham&#257;rs</i> (tanners). Her favourite resort is near the
Dhedv&#257;d&#257; (<i>i.e.</i>, a quarter inhabited by sweepers). A
childless Girasia is said to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1060"

lands to her; but they are no longer in the possession of the
attendants.<a class="noteref" id="n19.1src" href="#n19.1" name=
"n19.1src">43</a></p>
<p>(12) Hanuman.&mdash;On a mound of earth there is an old worn-out
image of this god. People sometimes light a lamp there, offer cocoanuts
and plaster the image with red-lead and oil. A <i>s&#257;dhu</i> of the
M&#257;ragi sect, a Koli by birth, acts as <i>pujari</i>.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n19.1">43</a></p>
<p>(13) Shakt&#257; (or shakti).&mdash;This is a Girasia goddess
attended upon by a Chumv&#257;li&#257; Koli. On the Navar&#257;tra
days, as well as on the following day, Girasias worship this goddess,
and if necessary observe vows in her name.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n19.1">43</a></p>
<p>(14) Harsidh.&mdash;G&#257;ndhavi in Bard&#257; and Ujjain are the
places dedicated to this goddess. There is a tradition connected with
her that her image stood in a place of worship facing the sea on Mount
Koyalo in Gandhavi. She was believed to sink or swallow all the vessels
that sailed by. A Bania named Jagadus&#257;, knowing this, propitiated
her by the performance of religious austerities. On being asked what
boon he wanted from her, he requested her to descend from her
mountain-seat. She agreed on the Bania promising to offer a living
victim for every footstep she took in descending. Thus he sacrificed
one victim after another until the number of victims he had brought was
exhausted. He then first offered his four or five children, then his
wife and lastly himself. In reward for his self-devotion the goddess
faced towards Miani and no mishaps are believed to take place in the
village.<a class="noteref" id="n19.2src" href="#n19.2" name=
"n19.2src">44</a></p>
<p>(15) Hinglaj.&mdash;This goddess has a place of worship a hundred
and fifty miles from Karachi in Sind, to which her devotees and
believers make pilgrimage.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=

<p>In the village of J&#257;sd&#257;n, in Kathiawar, there is an
ancient shrine of K&#257;lu-P&#299;r in whose memory there are two
sepulchres covered with costly fabrics, and a large flag floats over
the building. Both Hindus and Musalmans believe<a class="noteref" id=
"n19.asrc" href="#n19.a" name="n19.asrc">45</a> in this saint, and
offer cocoanuts, sweetmeats and money to his soul. A part of the
offering being passed through the smoke of frankincense, burning in a
brazier near the saint&rsquo;s grave in the shrine, the rest is
returned to the offerer. Every morning and evening a big kettle-drum is

<p>The sun, the beneficent night-dispelling, light-bestowing great
luminary, is believed to be the visible manifestation of the Almighty
God,<a class="noteref" id="n20.5src" href="#n20.5" name=
"n20.5src">58</a> and inspires the human mind with a feeling of
grateful reverence which finds expression in titles like

life and activity<a class="noteref" id="n20.6src" href="#n20.6" name=

<p>He is the chief rain-sender<a class="noteref" id="n20.7src" href=
"#n20.7" name="n20.7src">60</a>; there is a couplet used in Gujarat
illustrative of this belief. It runs:&mdash;&ldquo;Oblations are cast
into the Fire: the smoke carries the prayers to the sun; the Divine
Luminary, propitiated, responds in sending down gentle showers.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The sacred smoke, rising from the sacrificial offerings, ascends
through the ethereal regions to the Sun. He transforms it into the
rain-giving clouds, the rains produce food, and food produces the
powers of generation and multiplication and plenty. Thus, the sun, as
the propagator of animal life, is believed to be the highest
deity.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n20.7">60</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is pretty generally believed that vows in honour of the sun are
highly efficacious in curing eye-diseases and strengthening the
eyesight. Mr. Damodar Karsonji Pandya quotes from the
Bhagvadg&#299;t&#257; the saying of Krishna:</p>

the sun imparts his lustre either to the bodies or to the eyes of his
devotees. It is said that a Rajput woman of Gom&#257;t&#257; in Gondal
and a Brahman of Rajkot were cured of white leprosy by vows in honour
of the sun.<a class="noteref" id="n20.8src" href="#n20.8" name=

vows in honour of the sun.<a class="noteref" id="n20.9src" href=

<p>Women believe that a vow or a <i>vrat</i> made to the sun is the
sure means of attaining their desires. Chiefly their vows are made with
the object of securing a son. On the fulfilment of this desire, in
gratitude to the Great Luminary, the child is often called after him,
and given such a name as Suraj-R&#257;m, Bh&#257;nu-Shankar,
Ravi-Shankar, Adit-R&#257;m.<a class="noteref" id="n20.11src" href=

<p>Many cradles are received as presents at the temple of
M&#257;ndavr&#257;j, indicating that the barren women who had made vows

<p>According to Forbes&rsquo;s R&#257;sm&#257;l&#257;, the sun revealed
to the K&#257;this the plan of regaining their lost kingdom, and thus
commanded their devout worship and reverence. The temple named

<p>It is customary among Hindus to cleanse their teeth every morning
with a wooden stick, known as <i>d&#257;tan</i><a class="noteref" id=
"n21.bsrc" href="#n21.b" name="n21.bsrc">79</a> and then to offer
salutations to the sun in the form of a verse which means: &ldquo;Oh
God, the <i>d&#257;tans</i> are torn asunder and the sins disappear. Oh
the penetrator of the innermost parts, forgive us our sins. Do good

morning prayers and <i>arghyas</i> to the sun.<a class="noteref" id=

every Brahman, <i>i.e.</i>, every Brahman should perform the
<i>Sandhy&#257;</i> thrice during the day: in the morning, at mid-day
and in the evening. The <i>Sandhy&#257;</i> is the prayer a Brahman
offers, sitting in divine meditation, when he offers three
<i>arghyas</i> to the sun and recites the G&#257;yatr&#299; mantra 108
times.<a class="noteref" id="n22.3src" href="#n22.3" name=
"n22.3src">83</a></p>
<p>The <i>arghya</i> is an offering of water in a spoon half filled
with barley seeds, sesamum seeds, sandal ointment, rice, and white
flowers. In offering the <i>arghya</i> the right foot is folded below
the left, the spoon is lifted to the forehead and is emptied towards
the sun after reciting the G&#257;yatr&#299; mantra.<a class="noteref"

the thumb as is done in counting. Then the tips of the fingers are made
to touch the palm of the other hand. Then one hand is laid over the

<p>(1) In K&#257;rtika, the first month, the devotee is to take only
three leaves of the Tulsi or the holy basil plant.</p>
<p>(2) In M&#257;rgash&#299;rsha, the devotee may only lick a few
pieces of candied sugar.</p>
<p>(3) In Pausha, the devotee may chew three stalks of green darbha
grass.</p>
<p>(4) In M&#257;gha, a few seeds of sesamum and sugar mixed together
may be swallowed.</p>
<p>(5) In Ph&#257;lguna, a consecrated draught of curds and sugar may
be drunk.</p>
<p>(6) In Chaitra, people should break their fasts with a little ghi
and molasses.</p>
<p>(7) In Vaish&#257;kha, the only satisfaction allowed to those
observing the <i>vrat</i> is to lick their own palms three times.</p>
<p>(8) In Jyeshtha, the fast is observed simply on three <i>anjalis</i>
or palmfuls of pure water.</p>
<p>(9) In Ash&#257;dha, three chillies may be eaten.</p>
<p>(10) In Shr&#257;vana, only cow-urine and molasses are tasted.</p>
<p>(11) In Bh&#257;drapada, cow-dung and sugar are partaken of.</p>
<p>(12) In &#256;shvina, the application of chandan (sandal wood)
either in the form of an ointment or of powder.</p>
<p>Only a few very pious and enthusiastic devotees observe all Sundays
in the above manner. In average cases, the devotee allows himself rice,
ghi, sugar, milk, <i>i.e.</i>, white food, the restriction being only
as to colour.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n23.5">98</a></p>
<p>People observing vows in honour of the sun take food only once

<i>i.e.</i>, the last day of a Hindu calendar month,<a class="noteref"
id="n23.9src" href="#n23.9" name="n23.9src">102</a> are set apart for
Sun-worship. The ceremonies of the worship are the same as those on
Sundays. In fact, in almost all the observances in connection with the
sun the same ceremonials are to be gone through. Very often a Brahman
recites the p&#257;tha directing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1622" href="#xd26e1622" name="xd26e1622">24</a>]</span>his hosts
or hostesses to perform certain ceremonial gestures. On the last of the
number of days which the devotee has decided to observe, the
<i>vrat</i> is celebrated and Brahmans are feasted. This celebration of
the <i>vrat</i> is known as <i>vratujavavun</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"n24.1src" href="#n24.1" name="n24.1src">103</a></p>
<p>The special occasions for Sun-worship are the Sankr&#257;nti days
and the solar eclipses.</p>
<p>In each year there are twelve Sankr&#257;nti days on which the sun
moves from one sign of the zodiac to another. Sun-worship is performed
on all these Sankr&#257;ntis, but Makara-Sankr&#257;nti, which falls on
the 12th or 13th of January, is considered the most important.<a class=
"noteref" id="n24.2src" href="#n24.2" name="n24.2src">104</a> The
Uttar&#257;yana-parvan falls on this day, <i>i.e.</i>, the sun now
crosses to his northern course from his southern, and the time of that
Parvan is considered so holy that a person dying then directly attains
salvation.<a class="noteref" id="n24.3src" href="#n24.3" name=
"n24.3src">105</a> On this day, many Hindus go on a pilgrimage to holy
places, offer prayers and sacrifices to the sun, and give alms to
Brahmans in the shape of sesamum seeds, gold, garments and
cows.<a class="noteref" id="n24.4src" href="#n24.4" name=

a Brahman or two, who are given dakshin&#257; after the meals.<a class=
"noteref" id="n24.6src" href="#n24.6" name="n24.6src">109</a></p>
<p>On solar eclipse days, most of the Hindu sects bathe and offer
prayers to God. During the eclipse the sun is believed to be combating
with the demon R&#257;hu, prayers being offered for the sun&rsquo;s
success. When the sun has freed himself from the grasp of the demon and
sheds his full lustre on the earth, the people take ceremonial baths,
offer prayers to God with a concentrated mind, and well-to-do people
give in alms as much as they can afford of all kinds of grain.<a class=
"noteref" id="n24.7src" href="#n24.7" name="n24.7src">110</a></p>
<p>The Ch&#257;turm&#257;s-vrat, very common in Kathiawar, is a
favourite one with Hindus. The devotee, in performing this <i>vrat</i>,
abstains from food on those days during the monsoons on which, owing to
cloudy weather, the sun is not visible. Even if the sun is concealed by
the clouds for days together, the devout votary keeps fasting till he
sees the deity again.<a class="noteref" id="n24.8src" href="#n24.8"
name="n24.8src">111</a></p>
<p>Barren women, women whose children die, and especially those who
lose their male children, women whose husbands suffer from diseases
caused by heat, lepers, and persons suffering from ophthalmic ailments
observe the vow of the sun in the following manner.<a class="noteref"
id="n24.9src" href="#n24.9" name="n24.9src">112</a> The vows are kept
on Sundays and Am&#257;v&#257;sy&#257; days, and the number of such
days is determined by the devotee in accordance with the behests of a
learned Brahman. The woman observes a fast on such days, bathes herself
at noon when the sun reaches the zenith, and dresses herself in clean
garments. Facing the sun, she dips twelve red karan flowers in red or
white sandal ointment and recites the twelve names of S&#363;rya as she
presents one flower after another to the sun with a bow.<a class=
"noteref" id="n24.bsrc" href="#n24.b" name="n24.bsrc">113</a> On each
day of the <i>vrat</i>, she takes food only once, in the shape of
<i>l&#257;psi</i>, in <i>bajas</i> of kh&#257;khar&#257; or pal&#257;sh
leaves; white food in the form of rice, or rice cooked in milk is
sometimes allowed. She keeps a ghi-lamp burning day and night, offers
frankincense, and sleeps at night on a bed made on the floor.<a class=

<p>People who are declared by the Brahmans to be under the evil
influence (dash&#257;) of S&#363;rya, observe vows in the sun&rsquo;s
honour and go through the prescribed rites on Sundays. Such persons
take special kinds of food and engage the services of priests to recite
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1711" href="#xd26e1711" name=
"xd26e1711">25</a>]</span>holy texts in honour of the sun. If all goes
well on Sunday, Brahmans, S&#257;dhus and other pious persons are
entertained at a feast. This feast is known as <i>vrat-ujavavun</i>.
Some persons have the sun&rsquo;s image (an ashtadal) engraved on a
copper or a golden plate for daily or weekly worship.<a class="noteref"

<p>The practice of making recently delivered women sit in the sun does
not seem to be widespread, nor does it prevail in Kathiawar. In
Kathiawar, on the contrary, women are kept secluded from sunlight in a
dark room at the time of child-birth, and are warmed by artificial
means.<a class="noteref" id="n27.11src" href="#n27.11" name=

to bring a woman into the sunlight after a certain period has elapsed
since her delivery. The duration of this period varies from four days
to a month and a quarter. Sometimes a woman is not allowed to see
sunlight after child-birth until she presents the child to the sun with
certain ceremonies, either on the fourth or the sixth day from the date
of her delivery.<a class="noteref" id="n27.12src" href="#n27.12" name=

<p>A ceremony called the Shashthi-Karma is performed on the sixth day

ceremony of giving a name&mdash;on the twelfth day. The mother of the
child is sometimes not allowed to see the sun before the completion of
these ceremonies.<a class="noteref" id="n27.13src" href="#n27.13" name=

<p>In difficult labour cases, <i>chakr&#257;v&#257;</i> water is
sometimes given to women. The <i>chakr&#257;v&#257;</i> is a figure of
seven cross lines drawn on a bell-metal dish, over which the finest
white dust has been spread. This figure is shown to the woman in
labour: water is then poured into the dish and offered her to

"#n28.3" name="n28.3src">162</a> Subhadr&#257;, the sister of god
Krishna and the wife of Arjuna, one of the five P&#257;ndavas,
conceived a demon, an enemy of Krishna. The demon would not leave the
womb of Subhadr&#257; even twelve months after the date of her
conception, and began to harass the mother. Krishna, the incarnation of
god, knowing of the demon&rsquo;s presence and the cause of his delay,
took pity on the afflicted condition of his sister and read
chakr&#257;v&#257;, (Chakravy&#363;ha) a book consisting of seven
chapters and explaining the method of conquering a labyrinthine fort
with seven cross-lined forts. Krishna completed six chapters, and
promised to teach the demon the seventh, provided he came out. The
demon ceased troubling Subhadr&#257; and emerged from the womb. He was
called Abhimanyu. Krishna never read the seventh chapter for then
Abhimanyu would have been invincible and able to take his life. This
ignorance of the seventh chapter cost Abhimanyu his life on the field
of Kuru-kshetra in conquering the seven cross-lined labyrinthine forts.
As the art of conquering a labyrinthine fort when taught to a demon in
the womb facilitated the delivery of Subhadr&#257;, a belief spread
that drinking in the figure of the seven cross-lined labyrinthine fort
would facilitate the delivery of all women who had difficulties in
child-birth.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n28.3">162</a></p>

<p>The figure <i>Swastika</i> (literally auspicious), drawn as shown
below, is an auspicious sign, and is believed to be a mark of good luck
and a source of blessings. It is one of the sixteen line-marks on the
sole of the lotus-like feet of the god Ishwar, the Creator of the
Universe.<a class="noteref" id="n28.4src" href="#n28.4" name=
"n28.4src">163</a> The fame of the good effects of the Swastika figure
is said to have been first diffused throughout society by
N&#257;rad-Muni, as instructed by the god Brahma.<a class="noteref" id=
"n28.5src" href="#n28.5" name="n28.5src">164</a></p>
<p>Various conjectures have been made concerning the origin of this
figure. The following explanation is found in a work named
Siddh&#257;ntsar. The Eternal <i>Sat</i> or Essence, that has neither
beginning nor end nor any maker, exhibits all the religious principles
in a <i>chakra</i> or a wheel-form. This round shape has no
circumference; but any point in it is a centre; which being specified,
the explanation of the whole universe in a circle is easy. Thus the
figure &#9737; indicates the creation of the universe from <i>Sat</i>
or Essence. The centre with the circumference is the womb, the place of
creation of the universe. The centre then expanding into a line, the
diameter thus formed represents the male principle,
<i>linga-r&#363;p</i>, that is the producer, through the medium of
activity in the great womb or <i>mah&#257;-yoni</i>. When the line
assumes the form of a cross, it explains the creation of the universe
by an unprecedented combination of the two distinct natures, animate
and inanimate. The circumference being <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2111" href="#xd26e2111" name="xd26e2111">29</a>]</span>removed,
the remaining cross represents the creation of the world. The Swastika,
or Sathia, as it is sometimes called, in its winged form (&#21325;)
suggests the possession of creative powers by the opposite natures,
animate and inanimate.<a class="noteref" id="n29.1src" href="#n29.1"
name="n29.1src">165</a></p>
<p>Another theory is that an image of the eight-leaved lotus, springing
from the navel of Vishnu, one of the Hindu Trinity, was formerly drawn
on auspicious occasions as a sign of good luck. The exact imitation of
the original being difficult, the latter assumed a variety of forms,
one of which is the Swastika.<a class="noteref" id="n29.2src" href=
"#n29.2" name="n29.2src">166</a></p>
<p>Some people see an image of the god Ganpati in the figure. That god
being the master and protector of all auspicious ceremonies has to be
invoked on all such occasions. The incapacity of the devotees to draw a
faithful picture of Ganpati gave rise to a number of forms which came
to be known by the name of Swastika.<a class="noteref" id="n29.3src"
href="#n29.3" name="n29.3src">167</a></p>
<div class="figure p015width"><img src="images/p015.png" alt=
"Various ways of drawing the Swastika." width="374" height="365"></div>
<p>There are more ways than one of drawing the Swastika, as shown
below, but the original form was of the shape of a cross. The first
consonant of the Gujarati alphabet, <i>ka</i>, now drawn thus &#2709;,
was also originally drawn in the form of a cross (+). Some persons
therefore suppose that the Swastika may be nothing more than the letter
&#2709; (<i>ka</i>), written in the old style and standing for the word
<i>kaly&#257;n</i> or welfare.<a class="noteref" id="n29.4src" href=
"#n29.4" name="n29.4src">168</a></p>
<p>Though the Swastika is widely regarded as the symbol of the sun,
some people ascribe the figure to different deities, <i>viz.</i>, to
Agni,<a class="noteref" id="n29.5src" href="#n29.5" name=

who received the boon from her father of being worshipped on all
auspicious occasions.<a class="noteref" id="n29.9src" href="#n29.9"
name="n29.9src">173</a> Most persons, however, regard the Swastika as
the symbol of the sun. It is said that particular figures are
prescribed as suitable for the installation of particular deities: a
triangle for one, a square for another, a pentagon for a third, and the
Swastika for the sun.<a class="noteref" id="n29.10src" href="#n29.10"
name="n29.10src">174</a> The Swastika is worshipped in the Ratnagiri

Sun-god.<a class="noteref" id="n29.11src" href="#n29.11" name=
"n29.11src">175</a> The people of the Thana district believe the
Swastika to be the central point of the helmet of the sun; and a vow,
called the <i>Swastika-vrat</i>, is observed by women in its honour.
The woman draws a figure of the Swastika and worships it daily during
the <span class="corr" id="xd26e2175" title=

<p>A number of other ideas are prevalent about the significance of the
Swastika. Some persons believe that it indicates the four
directions;<a class="noteref" id="n29.13src" href="#n29.13" name=
"n29.13src">177</a> some think that it represents the four
<i>m&#257;rgas</i>&mdash;courses or objects of human
desires&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, (1) Dharma, religion; (2) Artha, wealth; (3)
K&#257;m, love; (4) Moksha, salvation.<a class="noteref" id="n29.14src"

<p>A Brahman host, inviting a party of brother-Brahmans to dinner,
marks the figure one (&#2791;) against the names of those who are
eligible for dakshin&#257;, and a Swastika against the names of those

patrons of the inviting Brahman, who is himself their

suitable days for such worship are the second and the fourth days of
the bright half of every month (Dwit&#299;ya or B&#299;j and Chaturthi
or Choth, respectively) and every full-moon day (Purnima or Punema). On
either of these days the devotees of Chandra (the moon) fast for the

<p>The fourth day of the dark half of every month is the day for the
observance of the <i>chaturthi-vrat</i> (or <i>choth-vrat</i>). This
vrat is observed in honour of the god Ganpati and by men only. The
devotees fast on this day, bathe at night after seeing the moon, light
a ghi lamp, and offer prayers to the moon. They also recite a
<i>p&#257;th</i> containing verses in honour of Ganpati, and, after
worshipping that god, take their food consisting of some specially
prepared dish. This <i>vrat</i> is said to fulfil the dreams of the

for a ride in their respective conveyances. It so happened that the god
Ganpati fell off his usual charger, the rat, and this awkward mishap
drew a smile from Chandra (the moon). Ganpati, not relishing the joke,
became angry and cursed Chandra saying that no mortal would care to see
his face on that day (which happened to be the fourth day of the bright
half of Bh&#257;drapad). If any one happens to see the moon even
unwittingly on this day, he may expect trouble very soon.<a class=
"noteref" id="n32.2src" href="#n32.2" name="n32.2src">207</a> There is
one way, however, out of the difficulty, and that is to throw stones on
the houses of neighbours. When the neighbours utter abuse in return,
the abuse atones for the sin of having looked at the moon on the
forbidden night. The day is therefore called (in Gujarat)
<i>Dagad-choth</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the Choth of stones.<a class="noteref"

<p>On the fourth day of the dark half of Ph&#257;lgun (the 5th month of

<p>Virgins sometimes observe a vow on Poshi-Punema or the full-moon day
of Pausha (the 3rd month of the Gujarati Hindus). On this day a virgin
prepares her evening meal with her own hands on the upper terrace of
her house. She then bores a hole through the centre of a loaf, and
observes the moon through it, repeating while doing so a verse<a class=

means: O Poshi-Punemadi, <i>khichadi</i> (rice and pulse mixed
together) is cooked on the terrace, and the sister of the brother takes
her meal.<a class="noteref" id="n32.5src" href="#n32.5" name=
"n32.5src">211</a> The meal usually consists either of rice and milk or
of rice cooked in milk and sweetened with sugar, or of
<i>kans&#257;r</i>. She has to ask the permission of her brother or
brothers before she may take her food; and if the brother refuses his
permission, she has to fast for the whole of the day.<a class="noteref"
id="n32.6src" href="#n32.6" name="n32.6src">212</a> The whole ceremony

<p>The appearance of the moon and the position of the horns of her
crescent at particular times are carefully watched as omens of future
events. Cultivators believe that if the moon is visible on the second
day of the bright half of &#256;sh&#257;dh (the 9th month of Gujarati
Hindus), the sesamum crops of that season will be abundant; but if the
moon be hidden from sight on that day, the weather will be cloudy
during the whole of &#256;sh&#257;dh, and will prove unfavourable to
vegetable growth.<a class="noteref" id="n33.1src" href="#n33.1" name=

the second day of the bright half of a month), and if the northern horn

if, on the other hand, it is low, it prognosticates a fall in prices.
If the two horns are on a level, current prices will continue.<a class=

<p>Similarly, the northern horn of the crescent, if it is high up on

<p>If the moon presents a greenish aspect on the full-moon day of

heat. If they fall on Wednesday, intense cold is said to be the result.

<p>Thunder on Jeth-Sud-B&#299;j, or the second day of the bright half

<p>The spots on the moon have given rise to numerous beliefs,
mythological as well as fanciful. One of them is that they are the
result of a curse, pronounced by the sage Gautama on Chandra. Indra,
the god of rain, was infatuated with the charms of Ahaly&#257;, the
wife of Gautama, and with the help of Chandra laid a cunning plot to
gain his ignoble object. Accordingly, one night, Chandra set earlier
than usual, when Indra assumed the form of a cock and crowed at
midnight in order to deceive Gautama into the belief that it was dawn,
and therefore his time for going to the Ganges to perform his religious
services. The trick was successful, and the holy sage being thus got
rid of, Indra assumed the form of Gautama himself and approached
Ahaly&#257;, who was surprised to see her husband (as she thought) so
quickly returned. The wily god allayed her suspicions by explaining
that it was not yet time for the morning ceremonies, and thus enjoyed
the favours due to her husband. Gautama, in the meanwhile, finding the
water of the Ganges cool and placid, and discovering that it was not
yet dawn, returned to his hermitage. On reaching home he detected the
treachery of Indra, who tried to escape in the disguise of a tom-cat.
The exasperated sage then cursed Indra, Chandra and his wife: Indra to
have a thousand sores on his person, Ahaly&#257; to turn into a stone,
and Chandra to have a stain on his fair face.<a class="noteref" id=
"n33.7src" href="#n33.7" name="n33.7src">223</a></p>
<p>Another mythological story is that Daksha Praj&#257;pati, the son of
Brahm&#257;, gave all his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2533"
href="#xd26e2533" name="xd26e2533">34</a>]</span>twenty-seven daughters
in marriage to Chandra, who was inspired with love for one of them
only, named Rohini, the most beautiful of them all. The slighted
twenty-six sisters complained to their father, Daksha, of
Chandra&rsquo;s preference for Rohini. Daksha in anger cursed Chandra
to be attacked by consumption (which is supposed to be the reason of
the waning of the moon) and his face to be marred by a stain.<a class=
"noteref" id="n34.1src" href="#n34.1" name="n34.1src">224</a></p>
<p>The curse of Gautama and the curse of Daksha are also supposed to be
reasons of the waxing and the waning of the moon.</p>
<p>Another belief regarding the moon-spots is that when the head of
Ganpati was severed by Shiva&rsquo;s trident, it flew off and fell into
the chariot of the moon. The spots are either the head itself<a class=
"noteref" id="n34.2src" href="#n34.2" name="n34.2src">225</a> or are
due to drops of blood fallen from the flying severed head.<a class=
"noteref" id="n34.3src" href="#n34.3" name="n34.3src">226</a></p>
<p>The spots are also said to be explained by the fact of the image of
god Krishna or Vishnu<a class="noteref" id="n34.asrc" href="#n34.a"
name="n34.asrc">227</a> residing in the heart of the moon who, as a
devotee of Vishnu, holds his image dear to his heart.<a class="noteref"
id="n34.4src" href="#n34.4" name="n34.4src">228</a></p>
<p>The moon is often called <i>mrig&#257;nka</i> (lit. deer-marked) and
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e2566" title=

(lit<span class="corr" id="xd26e2569" title="Not in source">.</span>
deer-stained); and a further explanation of the spots in this
connection is that the moon-god took into his lap a strayed deer, out
of compassion, and thus his lap became stained.<a class="noteref" id=
"n34.5src" href="#n34.5" name="n34.5src">229</a> Jains believe that in

<p>Once upon a time the gods and demons, by their united efforts,
churned the ocean and obtained therefrom fourteen <i>ratnas</i> or
precious things.<a class="noteref" id="n35.asrc" href="#n35.a" name=
"n35.asrc">245</a> These were distributed among them. Lakshmi, the
<i>kaustubha</i> jewel, the Sh&#257;rnga bow and the conch-shell fell
to the share of Vishnu, and the poison, <i>Hal&#257;hal visha</i>, was
disposed of to Shiva. Only two things remained, <i>sudh&#257;</i>, or
nectar, and <i>sur&#257;</i> or liquor. To both gods and demons the
nectar was the most important of all the prizes. A hard contest ensuing
between them for the possession of it, the demons, by force, snatched
the bowl of nectar from the gods. In this disaster to the gods, Vishnu
came to their help in the form of Mohini&mdash;a most fascinating
woman&mdash;and proposed to the demons that the distribution of the
immortalising fluid should be entrusted to her. On their consent,
Vishnu or Mohini, made the gods and the demons sit in opposite rows and
began first to serve the nectar to the gods. The demon R&#257;hu, the
son of Sinhik&#257;, fearing lest the whole of the nectar might be
exhausted before the turn of the demons came, took the shape of a god
and placed himself amongst them between Chandra (the moon) and
S&#363;rya (the sun). The nectar was served to him in turn, but on
Chandra and S&#363;rya detecting the trick, the demon&rsquo;s head was
cut off by Vishnu&rsquo;s discus, the <i>sudarshana-chakra</i>.
R&#257;hu however did not die: for he had tasted the nectar, which had
reached his throat. The head and trunk lived and became immortal, the
former being named R&#257;hu, and the latter Ketu. Both swore revenge
on Chandra and S&#363;rya. At times, therefore, they pounce upon
Chandra and S&#363;rya with the intention of devouring them. In the
fight that ensues, Chandra and S&#363;rya are successful only after a
long contest, with the assistance of the gods, and by the merit of the
prayers that men offer.<a class="noteref" id="n35.4src" href="#n35.4"
name="n35.4src">246</a></p>
<p>The reason of the eclipse is either that Chandra and S&#363;rya
bleed in the fight with R&#257;hu and their forms get
blackened<a class="noteref" id="n35.5src" href="#n35.5" name=
"n35.5src">247</a>; or that the demon R&#257;hu comes between the two
luminaries and this earth, and thus causes an eclipse<a class="noteref"
id="n35.6src" href="#n35.6" name="n35.6src">248</a>; or because
R&#257;hu obstructs the sun and the moon in their daily course, and
this intervention causes an eclipse<a class="noteref" id="n35.7src"
href="#n35.7" name="n35.7src">249</a>; or because R&#257;hu swallows
the sun and the moon, but his throat being open, they escape, their
short disappearance causing an eclipse.<a class="noteref" id="n35.8src"
href="#n35.8" name="n35.8src">250</a></p>
<p>Besides the mythological story, there is a belief in Gujarat that a
<i>bhangi</i> (scavenger or sweeper), creditor of the sun and the moon,
goes to recover his debts due from them, and that his shadow falling
against either of them causes an eclipse.<a class="noteref" id=
"n35.9src" href="#n35.9" name="n35.9src">251</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2737" href="#xd26e2737" name=
"xd26e2737">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>A third explanation of the eclipse is that the sun and the moon
revolve round the Meru mountain, and the shadow of the mountain falling
upon either of them causes an eclipse.<a class="noteref" id="n36.1src"
href="#n36.1" name="n36.1src">252</a></p>
<p>It is believed amongst Hindus that eclipses occur when too much sin
accumulates in this world.<a class="noteref" id="n36.2src" href=
"#n36.2" name="n36.2src">253</a> Most Hindus regard an eclipse as
ominous, and consider the eclipse period to be unholy and inauspicious.
The contact of the demon R&#257;hu with the rays of the sun and the
moon pollutes everything on earth. Great precautions therefore become
necessary to avoid pollution.<a class="noteref" id="n36.3src" href=
"#n36.3" name="n36.3src">254</a> A period of three
<i>pohors</i><a class="noteref" id="n36.asrc" href="#n36.a" name=
"n36.asrc">255</a> (<i>prahars</i>) in the case of the moon, and of
four in the case of the sun, before the actual commencement of an
eclipse, is known as <i>vedha</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the time when the
luminaries are already under the influence of the demon. During this
period and during the time of an eclipse people observe a strict fast.
Anyone taking food within the prohibited period is considered
<i>sutaki</i> or ceremonially impure, as if a death had happened in his
family.<a class="noteref" id="n36.4src" href="#n36.4" name=
"n36.4src">256</a> An exception is, however, made in the case of
children, pregnant women and suckling mothers who cannot bear the
privation of a strict fast. From the beginning of an eclipse to its
end, everything in the house is believed to be polluted, if
touched.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n36.4">256</a></p>
<p>As the sun and the moon are believed to be in trouble during an
eclipse, people offer prayers to God from the beginning of the
<i>vedha</i> for their release. It is the custom to visit some holy
place on an eclipse-day, to take a bath there, and to read holy
passages from the Sh&#257;stras. Some people, especially Brahmans, sit
devoutly on river-banks and offer prayers to the sun.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n36.4">256</a> Much secret as well as open
charity is given at the time of an eclipse. But the receivers of
charity during the actual period of an eclipse are the lowest classes
only, such as <i>bhangis</i>, <i>mah&#257;rs</i> and <i>m&#257;ngs</i>.
When an eclipse is at its full, these people go about the streets
giving vent to such cries as <i lang="gu-latn">&#257;p&oacute; d&#257;n
chhut&eacute; ch&#257;nd</i> (give alms for the relief of the
moon!).<a class="noteref" id="n36.5src" href="#n36.5" name=
"n36.5src">257</a></p>
<p>Among the gifts such people receive are cotton clothes, cash, grain
such as sesamum seeds, <i>udad</i>, pulses, and salt.<a class="noteref"
id="n36.6src" href="#n36.6" name="n36.6src">258</a> The gift of a pair
of shoes is much recommended.<a class="noteref" id="n36.7src" href=
"#n36.7" name="n36.7src">259</a> Sometimes a figure of the eclipsed sun
or moon is drawn in <i>juari</i> seeds and given away to a
<i>bhangi</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n36.8src" href="#n36.8" name=
"n36.8src">260</a></p>
<p>Although the period of an eclipse is considered inauspicious, it is
valued by those who profess the black art. All <i>mantras</i>,
incantations, and <i>prayogas</i>, applications or experiments, which
ordinarily require a long time to take effect, produce the wished for
result without delay if performed during the process of an
eclipse.<a class="noteref" id="n36.9src" href="#n36.9" name=
"n36.9src">261</a></p>
<p>If a man&rsquo;s wife is pregnant, he may not smoke during the
period of an eclipse lest his child become deformed.<a class="noteref"
id="n36.10src" href="#n36.10" name="n36.10src">262</a> Ploughing a farm

Ch&#257;ndr&#257;-children, <i>i.e.</i>, children afflicted by the
moon.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n36.10">262</a></p>
<p>After an eclipse Hindus bathe, perform ablution ceremonies, and
dress themselves in clean garments. The houses are cleansed by
cowdunging the floors, vessels are rubbed and cleansed, and clothes are
washed, in order to get rid of the pollution caused by the
eclipse.<a class="noteref" id="n36.11src" href="#n36.11" name=
"n36.11src">263</a> Unwashed clothes of cotton, wool, silk or hemp,
according to popular belief, do not become polluted.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n36.11">263</a> The placing of <i>darbha</i>
grass on things which are otherwise liable to pollution is also
sufficient to keep them unpolluted.<a class="noteref" id="n36.12src"
href="#n36.12" name="n36.12src">264</a></p>
<p>Brahmans cannot accept anything during the impious time of an
eclipse, but after it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2870" href=

gold, cattle and the like.<a class="noteref" id="n37.1src" href=
"#n37.1" name="n37.1src">265</a></p>
<p>After an eclipse Hindus may not break their fast till they have
again seen the full disc of the released sun or the moon. It sometimes
happens that the sun or the moon sets <i>gher&#257;yal&#257;</i> (while
still eclipsed), and people have then to fast for the whole of the
night or the day after, until the sun or the moon is again fully
visible.<a class="noteref" id="n37.2src" href="#n37.2" name=
"n37.2src">266</a></p>
<p>There is a <i>shloka</i> in the <i>Jyotish-Sh&#257;stra</i> to the
effect that R&#257;hu would surely devour Chandra if the
<i>nakshatra</i>, or constellation of the second day of the dark half
of a preceding month, were to recur on the Purnima (full-moon day) of
the succeeding month. Similarly, in solar eclipses, a similar
catastrophe would occur if the constellation of the second day of the
bright half of a month were to recur on the Am&#257;v&#257;sya (the
last day) of that month.<a class="noteref" id="n37.3src" href="#n37.3"
name="n37.3src">267</a> The year in which many eclipses occur is

<p>The Jains do not believe in the Hindu theory of <i>grahana</i> (or
the eclipse).<a class="noteref" id="n37.5src" href="#n37.5" name=

<p>With the exception that some people believe that the stars are the
abodes of the gods,<a class="noteref" id="n37.7src" href="#n37.7" name=

to be that they are the souls of virtuous and saintly persons,
translated to the heavens for their good deeds and endowed with a
lustre proportionate to their merits.<a class="noteref" id="n37.8src"
href="#n37.8" name="n37.8src">272</a> And this idea is illustrated in
the traditions that are current about some of the stars. The seven
bright stars of the constellation <i>Saptarshi</i> (or the Great Bear)
are said to be the seven sages, Kashyapa, Atri, Bh&#257;radw&#257;j,
Vishw&#257;mitra, Gautama, J&#257;madagni and Vasishtha, who had
mastered several parts of the <i>Vedas</i>, and were considered
specialists in the branches studied by each, and were invested with
divine honours in reward for their proficiency.<a class="noteref" id=
"n37.9src" href="#n37.9" name="n37.9src">273</a> Another story relates
how a certain hunter and his family, who had unconsciously achieved
great religious merit, were installed as the constellation
<i>Saptarshi</i><a class="noteref" id="n37.asrc" href="#n37.a" name=
"n37.asrc">274</a> (or the Great Bear). A hunter, it is narrated in the
<i>Shivar&#257;tri-m&#257;h&#257;tmya</i>, was arrested for debt on a
<i>Shivr&#257;tri</i><a class="noteref" id="n37.bsrc" href="#n37.b"
name="n37.bsrc">275</a> day, and while in jail heard by chance the
words &lsquo;Shiva, Shiva&rsquo; repeated by some devotees. Without
understanding their meaning, he also began to repeat the same words,
even after he was released in the evening. He had received no food
during the day, and had thus observed a compulsory fast. In order to
obtain food for himself and his family, he stationed himself behind a
<i>Bel</i><a class="noteref" id="n37.csrc" href="#n37.c" name=
"n37.csrc">276</a> tree, hoping to shoot a deer or some other animal
that might come to quench its thirst at a neighbouring tank. While
adjusting an arrow to his bowstring, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2955" href="#xd26e2955" name="xd26e2955">38</a>]</span>he plucked
some leaves out of the thick foliage of the tree and threw them down.
The leaves, however, chanced to fall on a <i>Shiva-linga</i> which
happened to stand below, and secured for him the merit of having
worshipped god Shiva with Bel-leaves on a <i>Shivr&#257;tri</i> day. He
was also all the while repeating the god&rsquo;s name and had undergone
a fast. The result was that not only were his past sins forgiven, but
he was placed with his family in heaven.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Similarly, Dhruva, the son of king Utt&#257;nap&#257;d, attained

<p>According to Hindu astrology, there are nine <i>grahas</i><a class=
"noteref" id="n38.asrc" href="#n38.a" name="n38.asrc">279</a> or
planets, twelve <i>r&#257;shis</i><a class="noteref" id="n38.bsrc"
href="#n38.b" name="n38.bsrc">280</a> or signs of the zodiac, and
twenty-seven <i>nakshatras</i><a class="noteref" id="n38.csrc" href=
"#n38.c" name="n38.csrc">281</a> or constellations. Books on astrology
explain the distinct forms of the <i>nakshatras</i>. For instance, the
Ashvini constellation consists of two stars and presents the appearance
of a horse. It ascends the zenith at midnight on the <i>purnima</i>
(the 15th day of the bright half) of Ashvin (the first month of the
Gujarati Hindus). The constellation of Mrig consists of seven stars,
four like the legs of a sofa and three others under them in a line. All
these twenty-seven groups of stars reach the zenith at midnight on
particular days in particular months; and the months of the Hindu
calendar are named after them.<a class="noteref" id="n38.3src" href=
"#n38.3" name="n38.3src">282</a></p>
<p>All planets influence the life of a person, one way or the other,
according to their position in the heavens at the time of his birth. A
<i>kundali</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a figure like the one shown here, is drawn
by astrologers to illustrate the respective positions of the planets.
The twelve squares of the diagram represent the twelve signs of the
zodiac, and the positions of the planets in different squares influence
persons in different ways. Ravi (the Sun), Budha (Mercury) and Shukra
(Venus) occupy one <i>r&#257;shi</i> for one month; Chandra (the Moon)
occupies a <i>r&#257;shi</i> for 135 <i>ghadis</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="n38.dsrc" href="#n38.d" name="n38.dsrc">283</a> <i>i.e.</i>, two
days and a quarter; Mangal (Mars) for one month and a half; Guru
(Jupiter) for thirteen months; Shani (Saturn) for two years and a half,
and R&#257;hu for a year and a half. This is their normal and ordinary
motion. But if they take an abnormal course and move either too fast or
too slow, they finish their revolution through a <i>r&#257;shi</i>
within a shorter or a longer period.<a class="noteref" id="n38.4src"

<p>If Shani (Saturn) occupies the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, or
the 12th square in a man&rsquo;s <i>kundali</i>, it causes despondency
of mind, family quarrels, imminent injuries from foes, and pecuniary
wants.<a class="noteref" id="n39.1src" href="#n39.1" name=
"n39.1src">286</a></p>
<p>The presence of Mangal (Mars) in the 3rd, the 6th, or the 11th
square is auspicious.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n39.1">286</a></p>
<p>Of the nine planets, Budha, Guru, and Chandra are benevolent, Mangal
and Ravi are neither benevolent nor baneful; and Shani, R&#257;hu, and
Ketu are downright malevolent.<a class="noteref" id="n39.2src" href=
"#n39.2" name="n39.2src">287</a> Each planet has a story connected with
it concerning its benevolence or malevolence, and showing also the way
to secure its propitiation. For instance, the malevolence of Shani
drove King Vikrama to unknown countries, and subjected him to grave
calamities. On the advice of a wise man, however, he observed the
Saturday-vows and thus overcame his difficulties.<a class="noteref" id=
"n39.3src" href="#n39.3" name="n39.3src">288</a></p>
<p>When a planet is unfavourable to a person, it has to be propitiated
by vows, and the person who is under its evil influence often lays upon
himself the obligation of abstaining from particular articles of food
or from wearing certain articles of clothing for a certain number of
days.<a class="noteref" id="n39.4src" href="#n39.4" name=
"n39.4src">289</a> Particular days of the week are set apart as
appropriate for the worship of particular planets, and, on such days,
the person keeping the vow observes a fast and worships the planet
through the medium of a Br&#257;hman.<a class="noteref" id="n39.5src"
href="#n39.5" name="n39.5src">290</a> For instance, <i>vrats</i> or
vows are observed on Tuesdays in honour of Mangal (Mars), when an image
of the planet, engraved on a golden dish, is worshipped, and the person
observing the vow takes food consisting of wheat only, and that too,
only once during the day. This mode of fasting is followed for a number
of consecutive Tuesdays prescribed by an astrologer; and on the last
Tuesday, when <i>p&#363;rn&#257;huti</i><a class="noteref" id=
"n39.asrc" href="#n39.a" name="n39.asrc">291</a> is offered,
Br&#257;hmans are feasted and <i>dakshina</i> is given to them. A piece
of red cloth and some corn are used in the installation of the planet;
these and the golden engraving are carried away by the priest.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n39.3">288</a></p>
<p>Similarly, in propitiating R&#257;hu and Ketu the same ceremonies
are gone through: only, instead of wheat, <i>mug</i> (<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3114" title="Source: Phasoleus">Phaseolus</span> mungo)
is eaten by the devotee. In the same way Shani (Saturn) is said to
favour the diet of <i>ad&#257;d</i> (or lentils): Guru (Jupiter)
inclines to <i>chana</i> (or gram), while Shukra (Venus) favours
<i>chol&#257;</i> (dolichos sinensis).<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n39.3">288</a></p>
<p>Certain forms or figures, called <i>mandals</i>, are favoured by
particular <i>grah&#257;s</i>, and are drawn in their honour in
worshipping them. Different things, too, are given in charity in honour
of different planets.<a class="noteref" id="n39.6src" href="#n39.6"
name="n39.6src">292</a></p>
<p>All the nine <i>grahas</i> and the twenty-seven nakshatras are
worshipped on the occasion of the <i>Griha-Shanti</i> ceremony, which
is performed before occupying a newly erected building.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n39.2">287</a></p>
<p>It is considered inauspicious to hold a marriage ceremony while
Shukra (Venus) is invisible. In such a case, however, the ceremony may
be performed after setting up and worshipping a small golden image of
the planet.</p>
<p>Of the stars, the constellation of <i>saptarshi</i> is perhaps the
one most often worshipped. Its worship forms a part of the ceremonies
performed on the occasion of investing boys with the sacred
thread<a class="noteref" id="n39.7src" href="#n39.7" name=
"n39.7src">293</a> and also of the ceremonies of marriage. The worship
of the <i>saptarshi</i> on marriage occasions is believed to be an
attestation of the marriage, and to secure the benign care of the
<i>saptarshi</i> for the couple. The form of worship is sometimes as
follows: a red and white piece of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e3168" href="#xd26e3168" name="xd26e3168">40</a>]</span>cloth is
stretched on the ground, bearing an image of the <i>saptarshi</i> over
it; wheat and rice are scattered over the cloth, a ghi-lamp is lighted,
and red lac and flowers are offered to the image.<a class="noteref" id=
"n40.1src" href="#n40.1" name="n40.1src">294</a> Another form of
worship is to mark seven red-lac-dots on a <i>p&#257;tla</i> or a
wooden stool, and to place seven pice and seven betel-nuts thereon.
After worshipping the seven pice, the bridal pair are made to take four
turns round the stool, touching the stool with their great toes at
every turn. A proverb runs to the effect that, whatever may happen to
the couple, still the seven pice of <i>satpati</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the
ceremony described) are secure.<a class="noteref" id="n40.2src" href=
"#n40.2" name="n40.2src">295</a> A third process is to form seven small
piles of <i>kamod</i>,<a class="noteref" id="n40.asrc" href="#n40.a"
name="n40.asrc">296</a> on each of which, successively, the bride
places her right foot while the bridegroom removes each pile one by

<p>The fifth day of the bright half of Bh&#257;drapad (the eleventh
month of the Gujarati Hindus) is observed as a day of worship in honour
of the <i>saptarshi</i> group. People observe a fast on that day.
Br&#257;hmans set up seven <i>ch&#257;ts</i><a class="noteref" id=
"n40.bsrc" href="#n40.b" name="n40.bsrc">298</a> in honour of the seven
sages, adding an eighth in honour of Arundhat&#299;, the wife of
Vasishtha, and worship them by <i>shodashopach&#257;r</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
sixteen-fold ceremonial). The worship is said to secure felicity for
departed souls.<a class="noteref" id="n40.4src" href="#n40.4" name=
"n40.4src">299</a></p>
<p>The <i>saptarshi</i> are also annually worshipped by Br&#257;hmans
on cocoanut-day (the 15th day of the bright half of Shr&#257;van) on
the occasion of changing their sacred threads. Hindu seamen also
worship the constellation on the same day.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In the performance of the <i>N&#299;l-parv&#257;n</i> ceremony,
which is held to propitiate the spirits of departed ancestors, and
which requires a calf and a heifer to be married, an entertainment
being simultaneously given to one hundred and eight Br&#257;hmans, and
on the occasion of Vastu or the ceremonies performed before or at the
time of occupying a newly-built house, burnt offerings and worship are
offered to the <i>saptarshi</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n40.6src" href=

<p>Married couples are made to look at the Pole star immediately after

<p>The twelfth day after the death of a person, known as
<i>T&#257;r&#257;-b&#257;ras</i> (or the star-twelfth) is kept as the
day of star-worship by the relatives of the deceased, when one member
of the family observes a fast on that day in honour of the deceased,
and takes food only after worshipping the stars at night. It is
customary on this day to give up the use of bronze vessels and to give
them away in charity.<a class="noteref" id="n40.7src" href="#n40.7"

<p>Just as persons carrying or accompanying a corpse to the cemetery

<p>The rainbow is believed to be the bow of Indra,<a class="noteref"

the <i>R&#257;m&#257;yana</i>, adjusted an arrow to the bow of Shiva,
to compete for the hand of S&#299;t&#257; in the swayamvara (or

into three pieces, which ever since present themselves as rainbows in
the sky.<a class="noteref" id="n41.8src" href="#n41.8" name=
"n41.8src">315</a></p>
<p>The rainbow is popularly regarded as an indication of good or bad
rainfall according as it appears at particular hours and in particular
directions. If a rainbow appears in the east a speedy rainfall is
expected; if on the other hand it is seen in the west, rainfall is
apprehended to be distant.<a class="noteref" id="n41.9src" href=
"#n41.9" name="n41.9src">316</a> Some people, however, believe the

scarce rainfall.<a class="noteref" id="n41.10src" href="#n41.10" name=

<p>According to the <i>Pur&#257;nas</i>, the milky way or
<i>&#257;k&#257;sh-ganga</i> is the celestial River Ganga which was
brought down by Bhag&#299;rath to the earth.<a class="noteref" id=
"n42.2src" href="#n42.2" name="n42.2src">324</a> King Sagar once
performed an <i>ashwa-medha</i><a class="noteref" id="n42.asrc" href=
"#n42.a" name="n42.asrc">325</a> sacrifice, when, according to custom,
he let loose a horse, and sent his sixty thousand sons with it. Indra,
jealous of the growing power of Sagar, stole the horse and concealed it
in the hermitage of Kapila, when the sage was deeply absorbed in
religious meditation. The sixty thousand sons of Sagar followed it to
this asylum, where they taunted and insulted the sage, believing him to
be the thief. Kapila, who was ignorant of the theft, opened his
long-closed eyes in anger, emitting sparks of flame from them, and
destroyed the sons of Sagar together with the whole of their army.
Bhag&#299;rath, the grandson of Sagar, propitiated the sage, and on his
advice practised religious austerities in honour of Shiva for the
purpose of bringing down the River Ganga from heaven. Through the
kindness of God Shiva, Bhag&#299;rath was at last successful in
bringing the celestial river down to this world; and with the water of
the river he revived the sons of Sagar. The River Ganga (<i>i.e.</i>,
the Ganges) in this world is therefore also known by the name of
Bh&#257;girathi. It is this heavenly river which we see as the milky
way.<a class="noteref" id="n42.3src" href="#n42.3" name=

in the celestial regions is held in great respect by the gods<a class=

purifies the heavenly bodies, just as the earthly Ganges washes away
the worst sins of mortals.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=

the holy Ganges descended from heaven to earth.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Another belief is that the God Vishnu, at the time of his V&#257;man
(or Dwarf) incarnation, touched the <i>ina</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the Egg)

as <i>&#257;k&#257;sh-ganga</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n42.6src" href=

the manner prescribed in the <i>Shastras</i>, to propitiate her against
interruptions in the completion of the work undertaken. The owner or
the person interested in the new construction pours a little water on
the earth where the foundation-pit is to be dug, sprinkles red lac and

<p>Another occasion for earth-worship is the third day of the bright

<p>On the eighth day of the bright half of M&#257;gh and also of
&#256;shvin (the fourth and the last month respectively),
<i>naivedya</i> (an oblation of food) is offered to the earth-mother,
and is then used as her <i>pras&#257;d</i> (gift). No cooked food is
allowed to fall on the ground on this day: even the leavings after
meals are given away to cows.<a class="noteref" id="n44.6src" href=

<p>When any ceremony is to be performed on the earth&rsquo;s surface,
as much of the spot as is required for the ceremony is cleansed by
watering it and plastering it with cow-dung. A betel-nut and a pice are

<p>On those occasions when <i>dakshina</i> is given to Br&#257;hmans
outside the village limits, worship of the earth-mother is performed by

single copper-pieces thereon.<a class="noteref" id="n44.8src" href=

<p>When Vishnu killed the demons Madhur and Kaitabha, the earth was
strewn with their flesh and marrow (<i>meda</i>). Therefore the earth

holy objects are allowed to touch it.<a class="noteref" id="n44.9src"
href="#n44.9" name="n44.9src">355</a> Another explanation is that the

the lives of men, and it is sinful in a Hindu to let it lie on the bare

<p>It is, however, maintained by some that the reason why certain
things, such as materials of worship, are not allowed to touch the

dedicated to this deity by a contact with the earth and would thus
become incapable of any further use, as things that are dedicated to

<p>The prevalent belief about lightning seems to be that it is the girl
whom Kansa tried to dash against a stone, but who escaped and went up
to the sky. Kansa, the tyrant king of Mathura, was informed by a
heavenly voice, by way of prophecy, that a son would be born to his
sister who would cause his destruction. Kansa thereupon confined his
sister Devaki and her husband Vasudeva in prison, loaded them with
fetters, and kept the strictest watch over them. He took from Devaki,
and slew, every child of hers as soon as it was born. In this way he
disposed of her first six children. On the seventh occasion, however,
on which Devaki gave birth to a son named Krishna, a girl was born at
the same hour to Nanda in Mathura; and Vasudeva secretly interchanged
the two children in spite of the vigilance of Kansa. When Kansa knew of
his sister having been delivered, he seized the infant girl and tried
to dash her against a stone. The little one immediately flew away to
the skies, where she still dwells in the form of <i>Vijli</i> or
lightning.<a class="noteref" id="n47.3src" href="#n47.3" name=
"n47.3src">386</a></p>
<p>The <i>Sh&#257;stras</i> describe <i>Vijli</i> as the distinctive

<p>Thunder during the Rohini <i>nakshatra</i><a class="noteref" id=

According to another view, if the Rohini <i>nakshatra</i> lasts for a
fortnight and if the sky is clear during the period and yet lightning

the weight of the fourteen worlds on his head; he bears the load as if
it were only a single sesamum seed. But when too much sin accumulates
in any of the regions, the burden becomes unbearable for him: he begins
to shake under it, and an earthquake occurs.<a class="noteref" id=
"n49.3src" href="#n49.3" name="n49.3src">417</a></p>
<p>Some believe that there is a tortoise under the divine cobra who
supports the world;<a class="noteref" id="n49.4src" href="#n49.4" name=

tortoise:<a class="noteref" id="n49.5src" href="#n49.5" name=
"n49.5src">419</a> and it is said that the slightest motion on the part
of either the tortoise or the cobra is the cause of an earthquake.</p>
<p>Another belief is that earthquakes occur whenever there is tyranny
or injustice on the part of a king, or whenever immorality spreads in
society, because the earth is unable to bear the sin, and trembles at
the sight of it.<a class="noteref" id="n49.6src" href="#n49.6" name=
"n49.6src">420</a></p>
<p>According to a different opinion, the earth is supported by the
<i>Pothia</i> or the favourite bull of Shiva on one of his horns. An
earthquake is caused whenever he transfers the earth from one horn to
another in order to relieve the former from the constant pressure of
the burden.<a class="noteref" id="n49.7src" href="#n49.7" name=

<p>There is also a belief that deities of some strange species reside
in the nether regions, and the earth is shaken whenever these beings
fight among themselves.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=

<p>According to the Var&#257;ha-sanhita, an earthquake is always the
precursor of some unprecedented calamity.<a class="noteref" id=
"n49.8src" href="#n49.8" name="n49.8src">422</a> The prevalent belief
in the popular mind seems to be that an earthquake is the result of

such as famine, pestilence, an outbreak of fire, a revolution, or a
great war.<a class="noteref" id="n49.9src" href="#n49.9" name=
"n49.9src">423</a> The phenomenon is, therefore, regarded with great

<p>The most popular of the holy rivers are the Ganges, the Jumna (or
Jamuna), the Narbad&#257;, the Saraswati (near Sidhpur), the
K&#257;veri, the God&#257;vari, the Gandaki, the Sarayu, the
D&#257;modari, the Sindhu (or Indus), the Mah&#257;nad, the Gomati
(near Dw&#257;rka), the Brahmaputra, the S&#257;barmati, the Ghels
(near Gaddheda), the Tungabhadra, the Suvarnabhadr&#257;, the
Bhadrashit&#257;, the Jambuvati, the Phalaku (or Phalgu), the Kaushiki,
the T&#257;mraparni, the Sita and the Alakanand&#257;. Any point where
three rivers meet is also a sacred place. Most of the holy rivers are
the subject of many traditions, and books have been written to
celebrate their merits.</p>
<p>The Ganges, the Jumna, and the God&#257;vari are said to be the
holiest of all rivers.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n49.9">423</a>
There are a number of beliefs about the origin of the Ganges. One of
them is that the Ganges is the stream caused by King Bali washing the
feet of V&#257;man (the Dwarf incarnation of Vishnu).<a class="noteref"
id="n49.11src" href="#n49.11" name="n49.11src">425</a> Another story
relates that the god Brahma was exhausted by overwork at the time of
the marriage of Shiva and P&#257;rvati. The gods, therefore, created
water from their own lustres, and gave it to Brahma in a gourd, to be
used in a similar contingency. When Vishnu in his <i>V&#257;man
avat&#257;r</i> (or Dwarf incarnation) bestrode the heavens with a
single step, Brahma washed his toe in the water from this gourd. A
stream was thus created called Swarga-ganga <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4381" href="#xd26e4381" name=
"xd26e4381">50</a>]</span>and brought down to the earth by
Bhag&#299;rath, the grandson of Sagar. When the Ganges fell from the
heavens, it was supported and held fast by God Shiva in his
<i>jat&#257;</i> or matted hair. It was released by his loosening the
hair, and in its course, inundated the sacrificial ground of King
Jahnu. The latter, being angry, drank up its waters. On the entreaties
of Bhag&#299;rath, he released the stream by tearing off his
thigh.<a class="noteref" id="n50.asrc" href="#n50.a" name=
"n50.asrc">426</a> The river then flowed to the spot where the sixty
thousand sons of Sagar were burnt to ashes; and it is said by some that
one of the sixty thousand was saved at the end of each year up to the
year 1955 of the Samvat era (corresponding to <span class="sc">A.
D.</span> 1899), by the end of which period all the sixty thousand had
attained salvation. From the earth the Ganges went to the nether
regions. Thus flowing in the heavens, on the earth and in the
P&#257;t&#257;l, the Ganges is called Tripathaga (<i>i.e.</i>, flowing
in three courses). In its divine form, the Ganges is the wife of Shiva.
Owing to the curse of Brahma, she was born in human form in this world
and was married to Shantanu, by whom she became the mother of Bhishma,
the heroic uncle of the Kauravas and the P&#257;ndavas.<a class=
"noteref" id="n50.1src" href="#n50.1" name="n50.1src">427</a></p>
<p>It is customary among Hindu pilgrims, when they visit K&#257;shi
(Benares) to take with them copper-vessels filled with
<i>Gang&#257;jal</i> (water of the Ganges), and to worship the
Gang&#257; when they reach their homes after the pilgrimage. A figure
is drawn in seven different kinds of corn; the bowl is placed on it;
<i>abil gul&#257;l</i> (red powder), frankincense, and <i>naivedya</i>
(an oblation of food) are offered: a ghi lamp is lighted: a Brahman
woman is dressed as Uma, the wife of Shiva, and Brahmans are
entertained at a feast, <i>dakshina</i> being given to them.<a class=
"noteref" id="n50.2src" href="#n50.2" name="n50.2src">428</a></p>
<p>The water of the Ganges, as well as that of the Jumna, is believed
to be so pure that it cannot be affected by microbes, even if kept for
years in the house. This quality is believed to be a manifestation of
its divine nature. It is further called <i>patit-p&#257;van</i> (lit.
purifier of the fallen), and exculpates the sinful from their sins,
either by a single draught or by bathing in it.<a class="noteref" id=
"n50.3src" href="#n50.3" name="n50.3src">429</a> <i>Gang&#257;jal</i>

<p>A vow is observed by women, in honour of the Ganges, for the first
ten days of the month of Jyeshtha. On these days they rise early in the
morning and bathe in the holy waters of the Ganges.<a class="noteref"
id="n50.5src" href="#n50.5" name="n50.5src">431</a></p>
<p>Sometimes ghi lamps are placed upon the waters of the Ganges or the
Jumna, and vessels of metal, pice, and cocoanuts are cast into the
stream. At such a time, when many people are standing on the banks
offering prayers with folded hands, or engaged in the
<i>arati</i>,<a class="noteref" id="n50.bsrc" href="#n50.b" name=

<p>The Jamuna or Yamuna is the daughter of the Sun, and the sister of

scene of the amorous sports of God Krishna.<a class="noteref" id=

to the God&#257;vari, and remains there for one year. During that year,
all the gods are believed to bathe in this river. Thousands of pilgrims
visit Nasik to offer prayers to the God&#257;vari, and after bathing in
the river, give alms to Brahmans. Similarly, on the Kapil&#257;shashti
day, on which six <i>jogs</i> or conjunctive incidents occur
simultaneously, the virtue of all <i>t&#299;rthas</i> or holy places is
believed to be concentrated in the God&#257;vari at Nasik.<a class=

<p>Besides the holy rivers, there are numerous <i>kunds</i> or sacred
pools which are regarded with equal reverence, and in which a bath has
the same efficacy for destroying sin. Similarly, they are equally
suitable places for the performance of <i>Shr&#257;ddha</i> ceremonies.
These <i>kunds</i> are the subject of numerous beliefs, and each of
them has a certain <i>m&#257;h&#257;tmya</i> or peculiar merit of its
own. Six miles to the east of Dw&#257;rk&#257;, near the sea-coast,
there is a <i>kund</i> called Pind-t&#257;rak, where many persons go to
perform the <i>Shr&#257;ddha</i> and the N&#257;r&#257;yan-bali
ceremonies. They first bathe in the <i>kund</i>: then, with its water,
they prepare <i>pindas</i>, and place them in a metal dish: red lac is
applied to the <i>pindas</i>, and a piece of cotton thread wound round
them; the metal dish being then dipped in the <i>kund</i>, when the
<i>pindas</i>, instead of sinking, are said to remain floating on the
water. The process is believed to earn a good status for the spirits of
departed ancestors in heaven.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=

<p>Waterfalls are not very familiar to the people of Gujar&#257;t.
There is a belief, however, that barren couples obtain issue if they
bathe in a waterfall, and offer a cocoanut.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>If a river source issues from an opening, in the shape of a
<i>go-mukh</i> (cow&rsquo;s-mouth), the stream is called <i>dhodh</i>,
and is considered as sacred as the holy Ganges. A bath in such a
<i>dhodh</i> has the same efficacy for absolving persons from their

<p>When a person dies an accidental death and before the fulfilment of
his worldly desires, his soul receives <i>avagati</i> (<i>i.e.</i>,
passes into a degraded or fallen condition), and it is not released
from this state till <i>Shr&#257;ddhas</i> have been duly performed in
its name, and the objects of its desire dedicated to it with proper
ritual. The same fate befalls those souls which do not receive the
funeral <i>pindas</i> with the proper obsequies. Such fallen souls
become ghosts and goblins,<a class="noteref" id="n54.asrc" href=
"#n54.a" name="n54.asrc">470</a> and are to be found where water is,
<i>i.e.</i>, near a well, a tank, or a river.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Those who meet death by drowning become goblins, residing near the
scene of their death, and are a source of danger to all who approach
the water; for instance, in Mon&#257;puri and S&#257;sai, there are two
<i>ghunas</i> (mysterious watery pits) haunted by <i>bhuts</i> (ghosts)
which take the lives of one or two buffaloes every year.<a class=

<p>Persons who are possessed in this manner, can be freed by

<p>There is a <i>v&#257;v</i> called <i>N&#299;lkanth v&#257;v</i> near

<p>Another ghost haunts an old <i>v&#257;v</i>, called Madh&#257;, in

But a male spirit named <i>Kshetrap&#257;l</i> resides in the
<i>kotha</i> (or entrance) of the <i>v&#257;v</i>, and saves those who

brings down the wrath of that deity.<a class="noteref" id="n55.2src"

<p>Sometimes, for the sake of <i>moksha</i>, a person takes

<p>When a well is to be dug, an expert is first called to select a
likely spot on which to dig. A Brahman is then consulted as to the
auspicious hour on which the work of digging should be
commenced.<a class="noteref" id="n55.3src" href="#n55.3" name=
"n55.3src">480</a> For this purpose, Tuesdays and those days on which
the earth sleeps are to be avoided. The earth is supposed to be asleep
on the following six days in every month, namely: the 1st, the 7th, the
9th, the 10th, the 14th and the 24th days following a
<i>sankr&#257;nti</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the day on which the sun crosses
from one constellation to another). Excluding these days, a date is
generally fixed on which the <i>Chandra-graha</i> (or the planet moon)
is favourable to the constructor of the well.<a class="noteref" id=
"n55.4src" href="#n55.4" name="n55.4src">481</a></p>
<p>On the appointed day, the expert, the constructor of the well, the
Brahman priest, and the labourers go to the place where the well is to
be dug, and an image of the god Ganpati&mdash;the protector of all
auspicious ceremonies&mdash;is first installed on the spot and
worshipped with <i>panch&#257;mrit</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n55.asrc"
href="#n55.a" name="n55.asrc">482</a><a class="noteref" id="n55.5src"
href="#n55.5" name="n55.5src">483</a> A green coloured piece of
<i>atlas</i> (silk cloth), about two feet long, is then spread on the
spot, and a pound and a quarter of wheat, a cocoanut, betels, dates and
copper coin are placed on it. A copper bowl containing some silver or
gold coins and filled with water, is also placed there; the mouth of
the bowl is covered with the leaves of the Ashoka tree (<i>Jinesia
Asoka</i>) and a cocoanut is placed over the leaves. After this, the
priest recites sacred hymns and asks his host to perform the

<i>n&#257;garvel</i> (a kind of creeper) and red lac.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n55.3">480</a> The expert who is called to
choose a proper site for the well offers frankincense and a cocoanut to

<i>kh&#257;t</i><a class="noteref" id="n55.csrc" href="#n55.c" name=
"n55.csrc">486</a> ceremonies are over, the host distributes sugar or
molasses among the bystanders, and offers a sum of money to the expert,
who usually refuses it, asking the host to spend it in charity. Those
who accept money give away a part of it in alms to the poor.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n55.3">480</a></p>
<p>Sometimes, to secure the unobstructed completion of the work, the
god Ganpati and the goddess Jaladevi are installed and worshipped
daily, till water appears in the well.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=

related about M&#257;n-sarovar.</p>
<p>Two kings once agreed that the two children that should first be
born to them should marry each other. But it happened that both the
kings had daughters. One of them, however, concealed the fact, and gave
out that the child born to him was a son. So that when the children
attained a <span class="corr" id="xd26e5314" title=
"Source: marriagable">marriageable</span> age, they were married to
each other according to the agreement.</p>
<p>But the wife found out the secret when she went to stay with her
supposed husband, and disclosed it to her parents, who invited the
counterfeit son-in-law to their house with the object of ascertaining
the truth. The alleged son, however, suspected the design and fled,
with a mare and a bitch. On arriving near M&#257;n-sarovar, the animals
went into the lake in order to refresh themselves, when there was an
immediate transformation; and the bitch and the mare came out a horse
and a dog. On observing this miracle, their mistress followed their
example and was also turned into a male. The story is still sung by
girls in a <i>garabi</i> (song) during the <i>Navar&#257;tra</i>
holidays.<a class="noteref" id="n56.9src" href="#n56.9" name=

<p>Mountains are held to be sacred in a variety of circumstances; thus,
some are valued for possessing medicinal drugs: some are revered as the
birthplaces of the gods, or as the residences of saints: some for

<p>Han&#363;m&#257;n, the monkey-god, once promised to take the

<span class="corr" id="xd26e5456" title=

Han&#363;m&#257;n supplied the requisite material by fetching huge
mountains. Whilst engaged on this work, he was one day carrying the
Govardhan mountain to the site of the bridge, when R&#257;ma issued an
order that all monkeys who were fetching mountains should deposit their
burdens at the spot where they stood at the moment of the order.
Han&#363;m&#257;n could not disobey the order of his lord, and he had
accordingly to drop the Govardhan mountain near Mathur&#257;. In order
to fulfil Han&#363;m&#257;n&rsquo;s promise, however, Vishnu held the
mountain over his head for seven days, at the time of his Krishna
incarnation.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n58.5">516</a></p>
<p>It is said that the inhabitants of the districts round Govardhan
formerly revered and adored Indra. But Krishna condemned this custom,
and introduced the worship of Govardhan. Indra was exasperated at this
conduct, and poured tremendous rains on Gokal in order to drown Krishna
and his followers. But Krishna held up the Govardhan mountain on his
little finger and sheltered all his people under its cover. The
mountain was supported in this manner for seven days, by the end of
which the rains subsided and Indra confessed himself vanquished. Even
now Vaishnavas form an image of Govardhan out of mud and worship it on

<p>As the abode of Shiva and as containing the sources of the holiest
of rivers, the Him&#257;layas are the most sacred of all mountains, and
possess many holy places of pilgrimage, such as Badrin&#257;r&#257;yan,
Ked&#257;rn&#257;th, Hardw&#257;r, etc. Badrin&#257;r&#257;yan is the
favourite resort of those who have relinquished the world and who only
wish to meditate on the Divine Being. The sages Nara and
N&#257;r&#257;yan are said to have performed religious austerities in
this place, and eighty-eight thousand <i>rishis</i> (sages) are
believed to be similarly occupied there to-day. Owing to the excessive
cold, the place is extremely difficult to reach. Pilgrims carry burning
hearths with them to protect themselves against cold. Besides, it is
necessary to cross the Pathar-nadi (or stony river), of which the
water, if touched, turns one into stone. The method of crossing this
river is to suspend <i>sik&#257;ns</i> or slings above its water and to
swing from one sling to another.<a class="noteref" id="n59.7src" href=

<p>A hill called Swarg&#257;rohan is believed to be twenty miles to the
north of Badriked&#257;rn&#257;th and is said to lead to heaven. In
ancient times the P&#257;ndavas had repaired to this place in order to
do penance for the sin of having killed their kinsmen in the Great War.
But when they tried to ascend to heaven by the Swarg&#257;rohan Hill,

<p>Mount Kail&#257;sa, the abode of Shiva, is supposed to be situated
in the northern part of the Him&#257;layas. The mountain is described
as always covered with verdure and full of beautiful gardens and of
palaces made of jewels, with roads paved with golden dust and
<i>sphatika-mani</i> (crystal stone).<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n59.7">527</a> It is said that R&#257;van, the king of Lank&#257;,
once uprooted this mountain and held it on the palm of his hand, in

Its eastern side appears white, the southern is yellow, the western is
black, and the northern red. The mountain is also believed to consist
of gold and gems. The Ganges, in her fall from the heavens, is said to
have descended first on the top of this mountain and then to have
flowed in four streams in four directions. The southern stream is known
as the Ganges; the northern, in Tartary, is called Bhadrasoma; the
eastern is the same as the Sit&#257;; and the western is named Chax or
the Oxus. The top of this mountain is believed to be inhabited by gods,

<p>The changes in the seasons are attributed by some to Brahma, Vishnu,
and Mahesha (Shiva), the gods of the Hindu Trinity. Brahma sends down
the rains and produces corn, grass, etc., Vishnu protects and nourishes
the harvests in winter, and Shiva causes the heat of the
summer.<a class="noteref" id="n60.6src" href="#n60.6" name=
"n60.6src">536</a> There is also a belief that these three gods go down
in turns to the <i>p&#257;t&#257;l</i> (nether regions) and stay there
for four months. Vishnu descends on the eleventh day of the bright half
of &#256;sh&#257;dh, and on that day the rainy season begins. When
Vishnu comes up and Shiva takes his place, people experience the cold
of winter: but as this god always keeps a <i>dhuni</i><a class=
"noteref" id="n60.csrc" href="#n60.c" name="n60.csrc">537</a> burning
near him, the waters under the surface of the earth, such as those in
the wells, remain hot during this period. Such waters are cooled when
Shiva returns and Brahma goes down to the <i>p&#257;t&#257;l</i>: but
the return of Shiva causes summer on the earth.<a class="noteref" id=
"n60.7src" href="#n60.7" name="n60.7src">538</a></p>
<p>According to another belief, the sequence of the seasons is
controlled by the sun-god.<a class="noteref" id="n60.8src" href=
"#n60.8" name="n60.8src">539</a> There are six <i>ritus</i> or seasons:
and the changes in the <i>ritus</i> depend upon the position of the sun

"noteref" id="n60.9src" href="#n60.9" name="n60.9src">540</a> Each
<i>ritu</i> lasts for a period of two months, during which time the sun
travels through two <i>r&#257;shis</i>. <i>Vasant-ritu</i> is the
period which the sun takes to pass through the <i>Min</i> (Pisces) and
<i>Mesha</i> (Aries) <i>r&#257;shis</i>. <i>Grishma-ritu</i>
corresponds to the time during which the sun passes through
<i>Vrishabha</i> (Taurus) and <i>Mithun</i> (Gemini). During
<i>Varsh&#257;-ritu</i> the sun moves through the signs <i>Karka</i>
(Cancer) and <i>Sinha</i> (Leo), and during <i>Sharad-ritu</i> through
<i>Kany&#257;</i> (Virgo) and <i>Tul&#257;</i> (Libra).
<i>Hemant-ritu</i> is the time which the sun takes to travel through
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5712" href="#xd26e5712" name=

<p>Indra (the god of rain), Varuna (the lord of all waters)<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e5737" title="Source: .">,</span> V&#257;yu (the god of
wind), Agni (the god of fire), and the moon-god are also believed by

href="#n61.2" name="n61.2src">542</a></p>
<p>The belief is as old as the <i>Vedas</i> that demons sometimes
obstruct the fall of rain, and confine the waters of the clouds. It is
Indra who fights with them and breaks through their castles by means of
his thunderbolt, sending down showers of rain for the benefit of his
worshippers. So, whenever there is an unusual drought, people still
invoke the aid of this god, and celebrate a festival in his honour,
called <i>Ujjani</i> or <i>Indramahotsava</i>. <i>Homas</i><a class=
"noteref" id="n61.asrc" href="#n61.a" name="n61.asrc">543</a> are
performed to propitiate the god, and Brahmans are entertained at a
feast. Sometimes the festival is celebrated outside the village, where
people go in large parties to dine together. The usual dish on such an
occasion is <i>Meghl&#257;du</i> or sweet balls of wheat-flour fried in
<i>ghi</i>.</p>
<p>Another favourite ceremony supposed to cause rain to fall is the
submersion of the image of Shiva in water, by blocking up the
<i>kh&#257;l</i> or passage in the <i>Shiva-linga</i> by which water
poured over the image usually runs off.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n61.2">542</a> This ceremony is known as <i>Jala-j&#257;tr&#257;</i>.
<i>Rudr&#257;bhisheka</i>, or the ceremony of pouring water in a
constant stream over the image of Shiva for eleven consecutive days and
nights, is sometimes performed with the same object.<a class="noteref"
id="n61.3src" href="#n61.3" name="n61.3src">544</a></p>
<p>Sometimes the assistance of Shringhi <i>rishi</i> is invoked to
bring about a fall of rain. The <i>rishi</i> is installed in water,
mantras are recited, and prayers are offered before a sacrificial fire.
This ceremony, called <i>Parjanya-sh&#257;nti</i>, is said to have been
performed within recent years in Bombay, and to have been successful in
bringing rain.<a class="noteref" id="n61.4src" href="#n61.4" name=
"n61.4src">545</a></p>
<p>It is also said that rainfall can be caused by singing a song or a
sacred hymn to the <i>mal&#257;r</i> tune. There is a tradition that
the well-known saint Narsinha Mehta once sang this tune on the occasion
of the celebration of the first pregnancy of his daughter, and the
performance was immediately followed by a shower of rain. Rain, which
is brought down in this manner, can be put a stop to by singing to a
different tune.<a class="noteref" id="n61.5src" href="#n61.5" name=
"n61.5src">546</a></p>
<p>Low-caste women have recourse to the following expedient to bring
rain. Five or six of them place a quantity of muddy earth on a wooden
stool, which is carried by one of them. The lump of mud is covered with
leaves of the <i>Gidot&#257;n</i> or <i>Tindot&#257;n</i> creeper, and
is called <i>mehulo</i> or <i>meghalo</i>. The whole party then sing
songs, and visit every house in the village. A bowl of water is poured
over the <i>mehulo</i> and the women receive some corn for their
trouble.<a class="noteref" id="n61.6src" href="#n61.6" name=
"n61.6src">547</a></p>
<p>Some believe that when the worship of the village-gods is neglected
and when the people grow corrupt, ill-treat the saints and are given to
the killing of cows and Brahmans, Yama, the God of Death, directs his
colleagues, Indra and Varuna, to threaten the world with a drought. The
rainfall returns only when the people revert to righteous ways, and
after Indra and Varuna have been conciliated by offerings.</p>
<p>The lower classes of the people believe a prolonged cessation of
rain to be due to the wrath of local minor deities, aroused by the
neglect of their worship. In such a contingency, therefore, they
prepare <i>b&#257;klan</i><a class="noteref" id="n61.bsrc" href=
"#n61.b" name="n61.bsrc">548</a> of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

to the local gods for their propitiation.<a class="noteref" id=
"n62.1src" href="#n62.1" name="n62.1src">551</a></p>
<p>To stop an incessant fall of rain, people often observe the
<i>&#256;ladr&#257;</i> vow. The patel or headman issues a proclamation
that on a particular day none should cook, or churn whey, or fetch
water, or wash clothes, or attend to any of the multifarious household
duties; but that all should pass the day in prayer. A complete
cessation from toil in favour of earnest devotion to divine powers are
the peculiar features of this vow. People do not abstain from food: but
food must be prepared on the previous day. If the rains do not cease in
spite of this vow, but threaten the village with inundation, the
headman leads a procession to the confines of the village and makes an
offering to the waters.<a class="noteref" id="n62.2src" href="#n62.2"
name="n62.2src">552</a></p>
<p>In some places a spinning wheel, sometimes specially constructed of
human bones,<a class="noteref" id="n62.3src" href="#n62.3" name=
"n62.3src">553</a> is turned by a naked person in the reverse direction
to the usual one, with the object of causing the cessation of
immoderate rainfall.<a class="noteref" id="n62.4src" href="#n62.4"
name="n62.4src">554</a></p>
<p>A cessation of rains is also believed to be brought about by
offering an oblation to the god Kasatia, and by the observance of the
vow called <i>Kasatia g&#257;nth</i> (or tying the knot of Kasatia).
The vow lasts for three weeks, and those who observe it do not partake
of anything except rice<a class="noteref" id="n62.5src" href="#n62.5"
name="n62.5src">555</a> (or, according to others, <i>jir&#257;n</i>, a
kind of spice<a class="noteref" id="n62.6src" href="#n62.6" name=
"n62.6src">556</a>).</p>
<p>Some persons attribute a heavy fall of rain to the wrath of Indra,
and offer ceremonious prayers to appease that god.<a class="noteref"
id="n62.7src" href="#n62.7" name="n62.7src">557</a> In some places
people engage the services of magicians to restrain the fall of
rain.<a class="noteref" id="n62.8src" href="#n62.8" name=
"n62.8src">558</a> Farmers sometimes brand the rain by casting burning
sparks upon it in order to stop an incessant fall.<a class="noteref"
id="n62.9src" href="#n62.9" name="n62.9src">559</a> Vows in honour of
<i>samudra</i> (the ocean) are also observed with the same
object.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n62.3">553</a></p>
<p>In the changing circumstances of life, women more readily have
recourse to religious vows for the fulfilment of their wishes than men.
This fondness of women for vows has brought into vogue a number of
vrats or religious observances which are practised by women only.
<i>Gangigor</i> or <i>Gan&#257;gor</i>, <i>Vat-S&#257;vitri</i>,
<i>Mol&#257;kat</i>, <i>Goutr&#257;t</i>, <i>Alavana</i> or
<i>Alunda</i>, <i>Eva-vrat</i>, <i>Tulsi-vrat</i><span class="corr" id=

masheshwar-vrat</i>, and <i>Surya-vrat</i> are instances of such
vows.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n62.1">551</a> The
<i>Mol&#257;kat-vrat</i> is observed by virgins from the eleventh to

<i>&#256;sh&#257;dh</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n62.10src" href=
"#n62.10" name="n62.10src">560</a> The <i>Goutr&#257;t-vrat</i> is
believed to secure male progeny, as well as long life to the husband.
It is observed on the fourth day of the dark half of
<i>Shr&#257;vana</i>, on which day women fast till the evening, and
then take food after worshipping a cow.<a class="noteref" id=
"n62.11src" href="#n62.11" name="n62.11src">561</a> The object of the
<i>Eva-vrat</i> (or <i>Jiva-vrat</i>) is to secure eternal exemption
from widowhood, the day for this vow being the last day of

<p>On the fourth day of the dark half of <i>Shr&#257;van</i>, women
observe a <i>vrat</i> called <i>Bolchoth</i>. In the morning the woman
worships <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6002" href="#xd26e6002"
name="xd26e6002">63</a>]</span>a cow and her calf (which must both be
of the same colour), applies a little cotton to the horns of the cow,
and makes an auspicious mark on the foreheads of both with red lac. She
then places an offering of betel and rice before the cow, takes four
turns round the pair, and whispers in the ears of the cow the words
<i>t&#257;run satya m&#257;run vritya</i> (your truth and my devotion).
A Br&#257;hman then recites the legend of the <i>vrat</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="n63.asrc" href="#n63.a" name="n63.asrc">563</a></p>
<p>After narrating this story, the Brahman takes the betel and other
things placed before the cow. The woman then returns home and takes
food for the first time during that day, the meal consisting of loaves
of b&#257;jr&#257;-flour and some preparation of <i>mag</i>
(<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e6020" title=
"Source: phaselus">phaseolus</span> mungo</i>). Some women take
<i>ghi</i> and <i>khir</i>: but any preparation of cow&rsquo;s milk is
strictly forbidden. Similarly, there is a prohibition against using
things which have been cut by a knife or scissors.<a class="noteref"

<p>The worship of the goddess R&#257;ndal is a favourite <i>vrat</i>
with Gujarati women. A bower is erected for the installation of the
goddess, and a <i>b&#257;jat</i> or a wooden stool is placed therein. A
piece of fine cloth is spread on the <i>b&#257;jat</i>, and a figure is
drawn in seeds of corn. A <i>kalasio</i> or bowl, with a cocoanut on
it, is placed over the figure. The cocoanut has two eyes painted on it
in black collyrium and a nose in red lac, and is decorated with rich
clothes and ornaments to represent the goddess R&#257;ndal. Ghi lamps
are kept constantly burning before the goddess for three consecutive
days and nights. An invitation is sent to the neighbouring women, who
bring offerings of ghi to the goddess, and dance in a group at night to
the accompaniment of melodious <i>garabis</i> (songs).<a class=

Sometimes, if a child is ill, or some misfortune is apprehended,

and unwidowed women, are invited to a feast in honour of
R&#257;ndal.</p>

<p>At the time of a marriage, women make the auspicious mark on the
forehead of the bridegroom and carry a <i>l&#257;man-divo</i><a class=

days preceding the date of marriage the bride and the bridegroom are
besmeared with <i>pithi</i> or yellow turmeric powder, when auspicious
songs are recited by a party of women invited to witness the ceremony.
When the bridegroom reaches the entrance of the marriage bower, he is
welcomed there by his mother-in-law, who carries him on her hip to his
seat in the marriage booth.<a class="noteref" id="n64.1src" href=

<p>It is necessary to make certain marks on the corpse of a woman, and
these marks are made by women only.<a class="noteref" id="n64.2src"

<p>The <i>Sh&#257;stras</i> have enjoined the worship of certain
higher-grade deities, and have prescribed certain ceremonials for the
purpose. But women are not authorised to make use of these ceremonies.
The reason is that the <i>Sh&#257;stras</i> regard women as inferior to
men and do not grant them the privileges given to the latter. They are
not allowed to learn the <i>Vedas</i> nor can the
<i>G&#257;yatri-mantra</i> be taught to them. The result is that women
are not qualified to perform the ceremonial worship of such
higher-grade deities as Vishnu, Shiva, Durg&#257;, Ganpati, and
Hanum&#257;n;<a class="noteref" id="n64.4src" href="#n64.4" name=

be performed by men.<a class="noteref" id="n64.5src" href="#n64.5"

<p>It is the duty of men only to worship the <i>shami</i> tree
(<i>prosopis spicegera</i>) on the <i>Dasar&#257;</i> day, and the
<i>Hut&#257;shani</i> fire on the day of <i>Holi</i>.<a class=

<p>Women are not allowed to worship the god K&#257;rtikey, who is said

<p>The fifteenth day of the bright half of <i>Chaitra</i> is the
anniversary of the birth of Hanum&#257;n, and a <i>vrat</i> called

<i>vrat</i>,<a class="noteref" id="n64.6src" href="#n64.6" name=

<p>People who practise the art of attaining mastery over spirits and
fiends, usually remain naked while they are engaged in the performance
of their mysterious rites. There are many branches of this black art:
for instance, <i>M&#257;ran</i>,<a class="noteref" id="n64.9src" href=
"#n64.9" name="n64.9src">584</a> <i>Uchch&#257;tan</i>,<a class=

<i>Stambhan</i>,<a class="noteref" id="n64.13src" href="#n64.13" name=
"n64.13src">588</a> <i>etc.</i>, and although the <i>meli
vidy&#257;</i> (sacrilegious art) is not held in respect by high-class
Hindus, it is popular among the lower <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6342" href="#xd26e6342" name="xd26e6342">65</a>]</span>classes.
There is a belief that knowledge of this art dooms a person to hell;
but it secures to those who master it a position of much importance,
and therefore finds many followers. The art consists in the knowledge
of certain mysterious incantations, which enable a person to influence
the spirits and to bring about certain results through their agency.
Not only has every person when learning this art, to remain naked, but
all those who make <i>prayogas</i> or experiments in it afterwards must
observe the same precaution. The night of <i>K&#257;li-chaudas</i> or
the 14th day of the dark half of <i>Ashvin</i>, is considered to be the
most favourable time for the <i>s&#257;dhan</i> or accomplishment of
this secret art of remaining naked.<a class="noteref" id="n65.1src"
href="#n65.1" name="n65.1src">589</a> On this day, it is the custom of
those who exercise the art, to go stripped to a cemetery in the dead of
night, and to cook food in a human skull as an offering to the spirits
residing in the neighbourhood. On the same night, some sorcerers, after
stripping themselves, are said to ride round the village on some
mysterious conveyance.<a class="noteref" id="n65.2src" href="#n65.2"

<p>A practice is noted among low-class people of performing a
<i>s&#257;dhana</i> before the goddess Jh&#257;mpadi for the sake of
progeny. The man who performs the <i>s&#257;dhana</i>, has first to go
naked to a cemetery on a Sunday night, and to fetch therefrom the ashes
of a corpse. At the time of the <i>s&#257;dhana</i>, the man takes his
seat on a corpse, fills a <i>madaliun</i> or hollow bracelet with the
ashes brought from the cemetery, and puts it on his arm above the
elbow<span class="corr" id="xd26e6377" title=

<p>The hook-shaped instrument, known as <i>ganeshio</i>, which is used
by thieves in boring a hole through the walls of a house, is sometimes
prepared by a blacksmith and his wife on the night of
<i>K&#257;li-chaudas</i>, both being naked at the time. Instruments
prepared in this fashion are believed to secure success for the thief,
who scrupulously sets aside the first booty acquired by the help of the
<i>ganeshio</i> for the blacksmith as a reward for his services. He
does not grudge the reward however large the booty may be.<a class=

<p>There are two goals which a pious Hindu tries to attain by leading a
life of purity and virtue, <i>viz.</i>, (i) <i>moksha</i> or final
emancipation, merging into the Eternal Spirit, and (ii) <i>swarga</i>
(heaven or paradise) where meritorious persons enjoy pure pleasures
unalloyed by earthly cares. The stars are the spirits of so many
righteous persons who are translated to <i>swarga</i> for their good
actions, and are endowed with a lustre proportionate to their
individual merits. But every moment of enjoyment in <i>swarga</i>
diminishes the store of merit: and those whose whole merit is thus
exhausted, on receiving their proportionate share of pleasures, must
resume their worldly existence. The Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; says:
&ldquo;<span lang="sa">&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2368;&#2339;&#2375;
&#2346;&#2369;&#2339;&#2381;&#2351;&#2375;
&#2350;&#2352;&#2381;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2354;&#2379;&#2325;&#2306;
&#2357;&#2367;&#2358;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367;</span>&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;they enter the mortal world when their merit is
expended.&rdquo; Meteors are believed to be spirits of this description
who fall from their position as stars, to live again on this
earth.<a class="noteref" id="n66.9src" href="#n66.9" name=
"n66.9src">609</a></p>
<p>Another explanation of meteors is that they are the sparks produced
when the <i>vim&#257;ns</i> (or vehicles) of celestial people clash
against each other.<a class="noteref" id="n66.10src" href="#n66.10"
name="n66.10src">610</a></p>
<p>Meteors are also held to be the <i>ag&#257;r</i> or <i>charak</i>
(<i>i.e.</i>, excreta) dropped either by a curious water-bird,<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n66.2">600</a> or by Garud, the favourite eagle,
and vehicle of Vishnu,<a class="noteref" id="n66.11src" href="#n66.11"
name="n66.11src">611</a> or by a fabulous bird Anal.<a class="noteref"
id="n66.12src" href="#n66.12" name="n66.12src">612</a> The latter is
said to fly at an immeasurable height from the surface of the earth,
and to take food only once a day.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n66.12">612</a> It is almost impossible to catch the <i>charak</i>
when it falls to earth: but if ever it can be secured, the application
of it to the eyes of a blind man will restore his eyesight. It also
furnishes an effective remedy for leprosy, and gives a golden lustre to
the body of a person suffering from that disease.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n66.11">611</a></p>
<p>Some declare that meteors are stars which fall owing to the curse of
Indra, and subsequently assume the highest human form on
earth.<a class="noteref" id="n66.1src" href="#n66.1" name=
"n66.1src">613</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6636" href=

sins accumulate in the celestial world.<a class="noteref" id="n67.1src"
href="#n67.1" name="n67.1src">614</a></p>
<p>The influence of meteors on human affairs is treated at length in
the <i>Var&#257;hasanhit&#257;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n67.2src"
href="#n67.2" name="n67.2src">615</a> The phenomenon is popularly
regarded as an evil omen: it is supposed to portend devastation by

storms at sea.<a class="noteref" id="n67.3src" href="#n67.3" name=

"#n67.5" name="n67.5src">619</a> A shower of meteors is believed to
presage some civil commotion or a change in the ruling dynasties.</p>
<p>Some persons, however, regard the appearance of meteors as
auspicious or baneful, according to the <i>mandal</i> or group of
stars, from which they are seen to fall. Meteors from the
<i>V&#257;yu-mandal</i>, (or the group of stars known by the name of
V&#257;yu) portend the breaking out of an epidemic: those from
<i>Varuna-mandal</i>, are believed to be favourable to human happiness;
if they fall from <i>Indra-mandal</i>, they forebode danger to all
kings; those from <i>Agni-mandal</i>, threaten war between
nations.<a class="noteref" id="n67.6src" href="#n67.6" name=

href="#n19.asrc" name="n19.a">45</a></span> The tendency to fraternise
as much in belief as in nationality is a notable feature of Indian
life. The saying goes:&mdash;Hindu Musalm&#257;n &eacute;k R&#257;m
bij&oacute; Rehm&#257;n. The Hindu and Musalman are not far apart; one
is the follower of R&#257;m, the other of Rehm&#257;n (the most
compassionate&mdash;a Kuranic name of Allah). Again says another
proverb: The Hindu and Musalm&#257;n are as closely connected as the
breast and the skirt of a garment (Hindu n&eacute; Musalm&#257;n moli
d&#257;man jo vehev&#257;r). The Hindu pays homage to the P&#299;r, the
Muslim repays the compliment by holding some of his Hindu
brother&rsquo;s lower class deities, such as Vaital and K&#257;li and
Amb&#257;, in awe. The Hindu worships and breaks cocoanuts before the
Moharram <i>taazias</i>&mdash;the Musalman responds by showing a
sneaking sort of a regard for the Holi, whom he believes to have been a
daughter of the patriarch Abraham. This reciprocal good fellowship in
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1098" title="Source: time">times</span> of
political agitation, like those of the Indian Mutiny, results in the
&ldquo;chapati&rdquo;, or unleavened bread loaf, being considered a
symbol to be honoured both by Muslim and Hindu; and in more recent
times, as during the plague troubles in Allahabad and Cawnpore, shows
itself in the Muslim garlanding the Hindu on a holiday, and the Hindus
setting up sherbat-stalls for Musalmans on an Id day.&mdash;Khan

vow to grow the hair of their little children, if such are preserved to
them, observing all the time a votive abstinence from a particular dish

the vow is fulfilled by taking them to a sacred place, like the temple
of Ranchhodji at Dakor, to have their hair cut for the first time. This

holiday, which is also known as <i>Vijay&#257;dashm&#299;</i>, Hindus
take special dishes, dress themselves in their best garments and go out
of towns and villages to worship the earth-mother and the holy
<i>shami</i>, with <i>jav&#257;l&#257;</i> stalks, a few of which are
inserted in the folds of their head-dress as auspicious tokens. In
towns, and big cities a procession is formed, conducted by some city
magnate or a native chief riding an elephant. They go in state to the
place of worship, and after the completion of the worship a goat or a
he buffalo, preferably the latter, is killed, and a salvo of three to
seven or more cannon is fired. People then return home and prostrate
themselves before their elders, and receive from them a handful of
candied sugar, a betel-nut and leaf, with blessings for long-life and
prosperity. Such blessings are considered likely to prove
effective.&mdash;K. D. Desai.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">Several stories, in addition to the legend of the
R&#257;m&#257;yana, are related of the birth of the god Hanum&#257;n.
Dasharatha, king of Ayodhy&#257;, being childless, once performed a
sacrifice with the hope of thereby obtaining male issue. On the
completion of the ceremony a heavenly being rose out of the sacrificial
fire and presented the king with a celestial preparation, called
<i>p&#257;yas</i>, which he directed the king to give to his wives if
he desired a son. The king divided the divine gift among his three
queens; but the share of one of them was snatched away by an eagle. It
was dropped into the hands of <span class="corr" id="xd26e6736" title=

Indra in his evil designs on Ahaly&#257;, the wife of Gautama. She had
on that account been cursed by Gautama, and threatened with the birth
of a fatherless child. To prevent the curse from taking effect,
Anjan&#299; buried herself in the ground as far as her waist, and began
to observe religious austerities in the hope of propitiating Shiva. The
latter was pleased with her devotion, and sent her a <i>mantra</i>
through N&#257;rada, who was ordered to deliver it in her ear.
V&#257;yu, the god of wind, forced the <i>mantra</i> into her womb, and
she conceived a son named Hanum&#257;n. This son had the form of a
monkey, because, at the time of conception, Anjan&#299; happened to
behold a monkey, named Keshi, on a neighbouring tree.</p>
<p>Hanum&#257;n is a <i>chiranj&#299;va</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, one of those
seven<a class="noteref" id="n68.asrc" href="#n68.a" name=
"n68.asrc">1</a> persons who are to live for ever and are therefore
considered to be immortal. He is represented as possessed of miraculous
strength, and his body is <i>vajramaya</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, adamantine.
When S&#299;t&#257; was carried off by R&#257;vana, it was he who
crossed the sea and brought news about her to R&#257;ma. When Ahi and
Mahi, two cousins of R&#257;vana, carried off R&#257;ma and Lakshmana
by magic and decided to offer them as victims to their favourite
goddess Panoti, Hanum&#257;n entered the temple of Panoti, crushed her
under his feet, and released R&#257;ma and Lakshmana. Hence he is known
as the conqueror of Panoti. After the death of R&#257;vana,
Hanum&#257;n was left to guard the kingdom of Lank&#257;, which was
conferred by R&#257;ma on Bibh&#299;shana, the brother of
R&#257;vana.<a class="noteref" id="n68.1src" href="#n68.1" name=

<i>brahmach&#257;ri</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, one who has taken the vow of
celibacy), a powerful and benevolent deity, and a giver of many
blessings. At the same time, he is considered to be the master-deity of
all <i>bhuts</i>, <i>prets</i>, <i>pish&#257;chas</i>, (ghosts,
goblins, fiends), of <i>d&#257;kans</i> (witches), <i>shakans</i>,

of <i>yakshas</i> and <i>yakshinis</i> and of all evil spirits in
general, who are believed to obey his commands.<a class="noteref" id=
"n69.1src" href="#n69.1" name="n69.1src">5</a> Vows are observed in
honour of Hanum&#257;n if a person is possessed by a <i>bhut</i> or a

with a devil, or if he happens to step inadvertently within the
<i>kundalan</i><a class="noteref" id="n69.asrc" href="#n69.a" name=
"n69.asrc">6</a> of an <i>ut&#257;r</i>. Persons who are possessed by

<p>K&#257;li-Chaudas, <i>i.e.</i>, the 14th day of dark half of
Ashvin<a class="noteref" id="n69.bsrc" href="#n69.b" name=

practising the black art; and the god Hanum&#257;n is accordingly
worshipped with much ceremony by <i>bhuvas</i> on that day.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n69.1">5</a></p>
<p>All <i>bhuts</i>, <i>prets</i> and spirits are thus believed to obey
the commands of the god Hanum&#257;n. In the course of a
<i>s&#257;dhana</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the process of procuring the
fulfilment of certain desires through the favour and by the agency of
spirits) the latter are conjured in the name of Hanum&#257;n, so that
the <i>s&#257;dhana</i> may not prove inefficacious. For this purpose
the <i>Hanum&#257;n raksha mantra</i> is repeated one hundred and eight
times before the image of the god, the devotee remaining standing all
the time. A lamp of clarified butter is also lighted, and frankincense
is burnt. The <i>mantra</i> runs as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Om namo
Hanum&#257;n b&#257;l&#257; ghatap&#299;dam, p&#257;nik&#257;
rakhav&#257;l&#257;, lohaki kothadi, bajark&#257; t&#257;l&#257;,

b&#257;san, Hanum&#257;n hath&#275;la, bajark&#257;
kh&#299;l&#257;.&rsquo; It is neither pure Sanskrit, nor Gujar&#257;ti,
nor Hindust&#257;ni, but roughly it means:&mdash;&lsquo;Bow to the
young Hanum&#257;n, the tormentor of <i>ghata</i>, the guardian of
water, the iron-safe, the lock of <i>vajra</i>, the son of the gods and
the demons. Take your seat, the receptacle of Mahadev, O stubborn god,
O Nail of adamant.&rsquo; After the repetition of the <i>mantra</i>,
four nails are driven into the four corners of the seat of the votary,
and it is believed that the <i>s&#257;dhana</i> is thus rendered sure
of success.<a class="noteref" id="n69.3src" href="#n69.3" name=

<p>The god Hanum&#257;n is sometimes worshipped when a serious epidemic
is to be warded off. The usual mode of propitiating him in such cases,
and also in exorcising spirits, is to pour red lead and oil over his
image, to make an offering of <i>udad</i> seeds (<i>Phaseolus
radiatus</i>) and molasses, and to invest the image with a wreath of
one hundred and eight flowers of <i>&#257;nkad&#257;</i><a class=
"noteref" id="n69.csrc" href="#n69.c" name="n69.csrc">10</a> or of as
many leaves or berries of the same plant.<a class="noteref" id=
"n69.4src" href="#n69.4" name="n69.4src">11</a></p>
<p>The influence of the god is believed to be so powerful in some
places that it is said that a <i>bhut</i> or a <i>pish&#257;cha</i> is
at once exorcised from the body of a person who observes certain
ceremonies there. In some places the mere sight of the image of the god
has the same effect, and it is believed that ghosts shriek and fly from
the bodies of possessed persons, if these visit the images of
Hanum&#257;n. In Kodolia, about half a mile to the west of Lilapur in
Gujar&#257;t, there is a temple of Hanum&#257;n where persons suffering
from fever go on a Saturday, and take a meal before 2 p. m. at which
time the god goes out to graze his cows. This proceeding is believed to
work a cure in cases of fever and is called <i>anagah</i>.<a class=

<p>There are certain peculiar conjunctions of planets, which if they
appear in a person&rsquo;s horoscope, always bring him misfortunes. In
such circumstances, the person is said to be under the influence of
<i>panoti</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n70.asrc" href="#n70.a" name=
"n70.asrc">15</a> Such influence lasts for a period varying from one
year to seven years and a half.<a class="noteref" id="n70.3src" href=
"#n70.3" name="n70.3src">16</a> When the planet Shani (Saturn) enters
the 1st, 11th, or the 12th <i>r&#257;shi</i> in relation to a person,
the latter is said to be affected by
<i>s&#257;d&#257;s&#257;ti-panoti</i>, i.e., <i>panoti</i> extending
over seven years and a half.<a class="noteref" id="n70.4src" href=
"#n70.4" name="n70.4src">17</a> The <i>panoti</i> enters the life of
such a person with feet either of gold, silver, copper or iron: and in
most cases the result is disastrous. If the <i>panoti</i> affects the
head of a person, he loses his wits; if it affects the heart, it takes
away his wealth; when it affects the feet, it brings bodily ailments.
In order to counteract the evil effects of <i>panoti</i>, people
worship Hanum&#257;n as the god who crushed the malignant goddess
Panoti under his feet. On Saturdays red lead and oil, <i>adad</i>,
molasses are offered to the image of the god.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n70.3">16</a> Frankincense is burnt, a lamp is lighted, and a
wreath of <i>&#257;nkad&#257;</i> flowers is sometimes
dedicated.<a class="noteref" id="n70.5src" href="#n70.5" name=

services of a Brahman are engaged to recite verses in honour of the

<p>There is a belief that Hanum&#257;n cries out once in twelve years,
and those men who happen to hear him are transformed into
<i>hijad&#257;s</i> (eunuchs).<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n70.3">16</a></p>
<p>Oil which has been poured over the image of Hanum&#257;n and caught
in a vessel is called <i>naman</i>. It is sometimes carried in a
<i>v&#257;tki</i> (a small metal cup) and is burnt to produce
<i>anjan</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, soot used as collyrium). This <i>anjan</i>
is believed to improve the eyesight, and to protect a person from the
influence of evil spirits.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n70.2">14</a>

<p>Of the days of the week, Saturday is the most suitable for the
worship of Hanum&#257;n. Of all offerings, that of red lead and oil is
the most acceptable to him.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n70.6">19</a> When Hanum&#257;n was carrying the Drona mountain to
the battlefield before Lank&#257;, he was wounded in the leg by an
arrow from Bharata, the brother of R&#257;ma. The wound was healed by
the application of red lead and oil, and hence his predilection for
these things.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n70.2">14</a> It is also
said that after the death of R&#257;vana and at the time of the
coronation of Bibh&#299;shana, R&#257;ma distributed prizes to all his
monkey followers, when nothing was left for Hanum&#257;n except red
lead and oil.</p>
<p>Mostly <i>&#256;nkad&#257;</i> flowers are used in worshipping
Hanum&#257;n, but sometimes <i>Karan</i> flowers also are made to serve
the purpose.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n70.2">14</a> The favourite

<p>Bh&#299;ma the second of the P&#257;ndavas was begotten from Kunti
by V&#257;yu, the god of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7146" href=
"#xd26e7146" name="xd26e7146">71</a>]</span>wind, and hence was called
V&#257;yusuta. From his childhood he was possessed of miraculous
strength, and had a voracious appetite. Every day he consumed 12
<i>kalashis</i><a class="noteref" id="n71.asrc" href="#n71.a" name=
"n71.asrc">24</a> (or 192 maunds) of corn, and as much oil as is
yielded by 13 <i>gh&#257;nis</i>.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n71.a">24</a> He also required a maund and a quarter of betelnuts
after each dinner. These habits had procured him the name of Vrikodara,
<i>i.e.</i>, wolf-bellied. He played a very important part in the Great
War, and on the last day of the battle smashed the thigh of Duryodhana
with his ponderous mace. In his early days he killed several demons
including Baka and Hidimba.<a class="noteref" id="n71.1src" href=
"#n71.1" name="n71.1src">25</a></p>
<p>Bh&#299;ma never took food without first worshipping Mah&#257;dev.
On one occasion no temple of Shiva could be found within easy distance,
and in a rage, Bh&#299;ma turned his bowl upside down and set it up as
Mah&#257;dev. Such was the first installation of Bh&#299;man&#257;th
Mah&#257;dev revered to this day by all Hindus.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n71.1">25</a></p>
<p>Once upon a time Bh&#299;ma obstructed the stream of a river by
laying himself across it, when the river rose to the banks and
submerged a temple of Shiva near by. Shiva thereupon assumed the form
of a lion and pretended to chase P&#257;rvat&#299; in the guise of a
cow. Bh&#299;ma, in his true Kshatriya spirit, instantly rose from the
water in order to save the cow from the lion. But the latter gave
Bh&#299;ma a blow on the shoulder with one of his paws, and instantly
transformed himself into a sage. After Bh&#299;ma had fruitlessly
searched for the lion for a long time, he was informed by the sage that
it was he, Shiva, who had assumed the form of a lion in order to rouse
him from his position across the river. Shiva then favoured him with a
boon that the half of his body which had received the blow would be
turned into <i>vajra</i> (adamant). On Bh&#299;ma&rsquo;s request a
further boon was granted to him that he should in future be able to
digest as much as he could eat without suffering discomfort. Hence the
proverb: <i>Bh&#299;ma kh&#257;ve shakuni aghe</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="n71.2src" href="#n71.2" name="n71.2src">26</a></p>
<p>It is said that Bh&#299;ma once played at <i>navateri</i> (lit. nine
and thirteen), <i>i.e.</i>, he flung into the sky nine elephants with
his right hand and thirteen with his left. The corpses of these animals
were afterwards brought down to earth by Shukamuni to expiate king
Janmejaya&rsquo;s sin of <i>Brahmahaty&#257;</i>
(Br&#257;hman-slaughter).<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n71.2">26</a></p>
<p>In his whole life-time Bh&#299;ma is said to have fasted only on one
day, which happened to be the eleventh day of the bright half of
Jyeshtha and is now called <i>Bh&#299;ma-agi&#257;ras</i>. On this day
people who desire to be cured of dyspepsia observe a strict fast,
taking neither food nor water, and pass their hands over their bellies
repeating the name of Bh&#299;ma and also offer cocoanuts to his
image.<a class="noteref" id="n71.3src" href="#n71.3" name=
"n71.3src">27</a> On the night of <i>Bh&#299;ma-agi&#257;ras</i>,
persons who are anxious to obtain health, wealth and victory over their

<p>There is a large temple of Ganpati near the eastern gates of Dhhank.
It is said that this Ganpati informed a goldsmith, by appearing in a
dream, that he was buried in a particular spot, and promised that a son
would be born to him if he raised a temple in honour of the god. The
goldsmith satisfied the wishes of the god and was soon relieved from
the repeated taunt of the <i>v&#257;nzi&#257;pan&#257;</i>
(<i>i.e.</i>, the barrenness of his wife).<a class="noteref" id=
"n72.5src" href="#n72.5" name="n72.5src">37</a></p>
<p>The following tradition is connected with a place, about a mile from
Dhhank, called Dhhank-ni Fui. Dhhank was in ancient times a great city
and was known as <i>Preh P&#257;tan</i><a class="noteref" id="n72.bsrc"
href="#n72.b" name="n72.bsrc">38</a>. Once a <i>b&#257;v&#257;</i>
(recluse), named Dhundhalimal, came to reside with his
<i>chel&#257;</i> (disciple) in a cave on a neighbouring hill. Every
day the <i>chel&#257;</i> went about the city begging alms for himself
and his <i>guru</i>; but nobody except a poor <i>kumbh&#257;ran</i> (a
potter-woman) ever gave him anything. So the <i>chel&#257;</i> was
obliged to cut and sell fuel in order to obtain means of subsistence,
although he did not mention this fact to his <i>guru</i>. One day the
<i>guru</i> noticed the growing baldness of his disciple and on being
questioned about it, the latter had to admit his difficulties in
earning a livelihood. The next day the <i>b&#257;v&#257;</i> decided to
test the charity of the neighbourhood, and went on a begging round in
person. He moved about the city from door to door, crying aloud
<i>&#257;lek &#257;lek</i>, but nobody except the <i>kumbh&#257;r</i>
woman offered him so much as a handful of flour. He then addressed the
latter thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Girl, this city is sinful and will shortly
meet with destruction. Fly, therefore, instantly with your family and
never turn your face towards the city in your flight&rdquo;. Having
thus warned the only righteous person in the city, the
<i>b&#257;v&#257;</i> returned to his cave where, after reciting an
incantation in high exasperation, he pronounced a terrible curse for
the destruction of the city &lsquo;Let P&#257;tan be buried and let
<i>m&#257;y&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="n72.csrc" href="#n72.c"
name="n72.csrc">39</a> be reduced to <i>m&#257;ti</i> (dust).&rsquo; A
whirlwind at once arose and destroyed the whole city. The
<i>kumbh&#257;ran</i> had already fled with her children; but she
unfortunately happened to look back in her flight, in spite of the
warning, and she and her children were all turned into stones. In this
form she can be seen even to-day, with two of her children on her
shoulders and leading the other two. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>To the south of the same village on the banks of a small lake are
situated the temples of Hinglaj M&#257;t&#257; and K&#257;mdev
Mah&#257;dev. If there is a prospect of a drought in any year, the
people of the village make an offering of <i>l&#257;psi</i> to the
former deity in order to bring about a fall of rain. About two miles
from Dhhank there is a temple of Vikani, in whose honour vows are
observed for the cure of fractured bones of men and animals.
Br&#257;hmans are feasted at the temple of Hanum&#257;n at Timbo, four
miles away from Dhhank. At a distance of about two
<i>khetarv&#257;s</i> (fields) there is the shrine of Ashabi-pir where

theirs.<a class="noteref" id="n73.1src" href="#n73.1" name=

<p>The river Vinu meets the Bh&#257;dar, at a place two miles to the
east of Ganod, and the Moja also joins the Bh&#257;dar a little further
to the east. Hence the spot is called <i>Traveni</i> (a confluence of
three rivers) and is regarded as holy. The beautiful temple of
Baraneshwar Mah&#257;dev is situated here. Vows for feasting a certain

there on every <i>&#256;so-sud-bij</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the second day of
the bright half of &#256;shvin. The fair lasts for seven or eight days,
when Khojas from Bombay and even Zanzibar visit the place. A large
building, the Khoja-khana, is set apart to the west of the shrine for
the <i>sabh&#257;</i> (or meeting). The largest fair was held in
<i>samvat 1940</i> (1884 A.D.), when H. H. the Agashah paid a visit to
the shrine. There is a large gathering of people at the place every
<i>bij</i> day.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n73.2">41</a></p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e7398" title=
"Source: Husen-pir">Husen-p&#299;r</span> was a native of Kadi and a
Saiyed by birth. In his youth, with his father&rsquo;s permission, he
decided to remain unmarried, and took to travelling. In the course of
his wanderings he halted for a week on the spot where his shrine stands
at present, and was so charmed with the place, that he asked the owner
of it, a Rab&#257;ri, Almora by name, for permission to reside there
always. The P&#299;r was accompanied by two followers of the
Muj&#257;var fakir sect. The present Muj&#257;var attendants at the
shrine are descended from them, and stand in the 12th or the 15th
degree of descent.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n73.2">41</a></p>
<p>One evening (it was the 5th day of the dark half of Bh&#257;drapad)
the P&#299;r accompanied by his two followers went to the Bh&#257;dar
to offer the evening prayers. After the prayers were over, he told his
followers that a flood was soon coming in the river, and asked both of
them to leave him and return with their horses. One of them left the
place as directed: but the other placed his head on the
P&#299;r&rsquo;s lap and was drowned along with his master in the
flood, which came down as if in obedience to the P&#299;r&rsquo;s
words. Before dying the P&#299;r granted a boon to the Muj&#257;vars
that their line of descent would never fail for want of their heirs,
and that their heirs would always be his attendants.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n73.2">41</a></p>
<p>The same night the P&#299;r informed the Khojas of Keshod and
Kutiana that his corpse and that of his Muj&#257;var follower lay
unburied at a particular spot. The Khojas, accompanied by the
Rab&#257;ri Almora, visited the place in the morning and made ready to
carry the corpses to Jun&#257;gadh. They found to their astonishment
that the corpses could not be removed. Almora then recollected the
request of the P&#299;r, and told the Khojas of his favourite place.
The corpses were then carried to their present place of rest, and all
efforts of the Khojas to proceed further <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e7411" href="#xd26e7411" name="xd26e7411">74</a>]</span>proved
unavailing. At that time there was a village called Keralun about a
mile from the present site of Ganod. It is, however, uninhabited and in
ruins and its site is now known as the <i>timbo</i> of Keralun. The
Khojas erected a shrine over the place where the P&#299;r was buried,
and the tombs of his relatives were afterwards erected in the vicinity.
Vows observed in honour of the P&#299;r having proved fruitful in many
cases, the P&#299;r&rsquo;s fame spreads wider every day. The Gondal
Durbar has granted a <i>w&#257;di</i> (a piece of land) for the
maintenance of the Muj&#257;var family, who also receive the things
that are offered to the P&#299;r. The Khojas consider it a merit to
dedicate a portion of their earnings to this P&#299;r. People of all
castes from Ganod offer one <i>kori</i><a class="noteref" id="n74.asrc"
href="#n74.a" name="n74.asrc">42</a> at the time of the marriage of a
girl at their house. The knots of the marriage-scarves of newly-wedded
couples are untied here, and the ceremony of shaving children for the
first time is also performed in the presence of the P&#299;r. The usual
offering to the P&#299;r consists of <i>churamu</i> and
<i>kans&#257;r</i>: some people, however, offer a goat or a ram and
call it <i>p&#257;nechedn&#257;riel</i>.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>There is a hollow log of wood on the boundary of Lath, a sub-village
of Gondal and a mile to the South of Ganod. Long ago a fakir, while
accompanying a band of outlaws <i>b&#257;rvatias</i>, was killed in a
scuffle and was buried here. A <i>b&#257;bul</i> tree grew over his
tomb, and came to be known afterwards as Lakkad P&#299;r (the wooden
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7448" title="Source: Pir">P&#299;r</span>).
The tree after a time withered till its stem was reduced to a small log
with a hole in the centre. People observe vows in honour of this
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7451" title="Source: Pir">P&#299;r</span>
for the cure of cough and bronchitis in children. After recovery, the
children are made to pass through this <i>b&#257;k&#257;n</i> or hole
and an offering of <i>kans&#257;r</i> is made to the P&#299;r. It is
not only the Musalm&#257;ns who observe vows in the P&#299;r&rsquo;s
honour: Hindus also have the same strong faith in him.<a class=

<p>Nearly twelve miles from Vanod lies the temple of Bechr&#257;
M&#257;t&#257;, who is the patron goddess of the P&#257;vaiy&#257;
sect. A male buffalo is offered to her as a victim on the 15th day of
the bright half of every month. Near the temple there is the holy

<p>The village of D&#257;dvi possesses the shrine of Mangalsh&#257;
P&#299;r. Friday is the day for special worship of the P&#299;r, when
dainties and cocoanuts are offered, and a flag is hoisted. Frankincense
is burnt every evening.<a class="noteref" id="n74.2src" href="#n74.2"
name="n74.2src">45</a> There is also a temple of M&#257;chho, the
goddess of the Bharv&#257;ds, who offer her <i>l&#257;psi</i> and
cocoanuts on every <i>bij</i> day. They also light a ghi lamp and lop
off the ears of a goat or a ram, and offer the blood to the
goddess.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n74.2">45</a></p>
<p>In Kolki a <i>b&#257;v&#257;</i> of the Bharv&#257;d caste named

<p>There is a temple of Khodi&#257;r M&#257;t&#257; in Chok. The
goddess is worshipped by Atits, who offer her <i>l&#257;psi</i> on
every Dasar&#257; day. There is also a temple of Hanum&#257;n, where
the Kh&#257;khis bring an offering to the god every Saturday.<a class=

<p>In the village of Mot&#257; Devali&#257; are the temples of
Bhol&#257;n&#257;th, Mah&#257;dev and Pipaleshwar Mah&#257;dev. Both
the deities are worshipped by Atits, who perform the ceremony with the
usual materials of frankincense, a ghi-lamp, cooked food, and who also
blow a conch. It is said about Pipaleshwar Mah&#257;dev that none can
stay at night in the temple. Once a Br&#257;hman, who insisted on
passing the night there, was hurled to a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

of two fields. There is also a temple of Sw&#257;mi-N&#257;r&#257;yan
and three temples of Th&#257;korji where the ceremony of worship is
performed every morning and evening in the usual way with frankincense,
a ghi lamp, and <i>&#257;rati</i>. The shrine of Nil&#257;-P&#299;r on
the village boundary is revered alike by Hindus and Musalmans.<a class=

<p>In the vicinity of Chhatrasa, there is a temple of Kishord&#257;s
Hanum&#257;n. On <i>K&#257;li-Chaudas</i> day the people of the village
offer <i>churamu</i> and <i>vad&#257;n</i> to the god. The shrine of
Gebalash&#257; P&#299;r is situated two miles away from Chhatrasa, on
the boundary line between that village and Kal&#257;n&#257;.
Sweet-balls, or sometimes only molasses, are offered to this P&#299;r
on the fulfilment of vows observed in his name. Near the village gates
lies the shrine of Daudshah, of whom it is said that he deprives
thieves of their eye-sight, if they try to enter Chhatrasa. In the
Vishnu-mandir, <i>annak&#363;t</i><a class="noteref" id="n75.asrc"

<p>A temple of Khodiar M&#257;t&#257; surrounded by Pandari creepers is
to be seen on the way from Mojidad to Sanka. The Thakor of Limbdi used
to kill a goat before the goddess during the Navar&#257;tra holidays;
but an offering of <i>l&#257;psi</i> is now substituted for the goat.
There is another temple of the same goddess on the way to
Z&#257;b&#257;l&#257; where she is worshipped by the Bhadkav&#257;
Durbar. The attendants at both places are Atits, and the usual offering
consists of <i>l&#257;psi</i> and <i>kh&#299;r</i>.<a class="noteref"

<p>Every marriage-procession on its way to and from the place of
marriage has to offer a new earthen jar to such field-deities as
D&#257;dmokhodiar, L&#257;lo, Hard&#257;s, etc. Failure to do so
arouses the wrath of these deities and brings disasters to the married
couple. The only form of worship in use for these deities is to apply
red lead and oil to their images. Seven kinds of corn, <i>viz.</i>
<i>ad&#257;d</i> (phaseolus radiatus), <i>mag</i> (phaseolus mungo),
<i>kalathi</i>, <i>math</i>, <i>chan&#257;</i> (gram), wheat and
<i>juvari</i> are mixed and cooked together and the preparation which

<p>The village of Aman possesses the holy tomb of Davalshah P&#299;r.
This P&#299;r lived in the 15th century and was a native of Ahmedabad.
He had come to serve in the Amaran <i>th&#257;na</i>, when he was
killed in a battle. A tomb was built over his body, and he soon came to
be regarded as a P&#299;r. His name became famous when a blind
Bharv&#257;d regained his eye-sight through his favour. The P&#299;r
also gave a son to a Bania from Ahmedabad who visits the tomb every
year in a black suit. Once a Miana killed a cow and took refuge at the
shrine of this P&#299;r: but the shrine spontaneously caught fire and
he was burnt with it. The present building was erected by the Bania,
and the ladies of the Jamsaheb&rsquo;s court have supplied silver gates
and copper railings to it. The Jamsaheb also presents <i>kinkhab</i>
coverings for the tomb every year. On the night of the <i>Uras</i> (or
the fair held in the P&#299;r&rsquo;s honour) sandalwood is burnt
before the P&#299;r.<a class="noteref" id="n76.2src" href="#n76.2"

<p>Charadwa is well-known for the temple of R&#257;jeshwari
M&#257;t&#257;. King Prithwi R&#257;j Choh&#257;n suffered from white
leprosy and was once going to Dw&#257;rk&#257;, with the hope that
residence in the holy city would cure him of his disease. On the way,
one of his best bullocks suddenly fell. The animal was almost given up
for dead when a young woman named R&#257;jb&#257;i, daughter of
Ud&#257; Ch&#257;ran, happened to pass by while carrying water in
earthen pots. R&#257;jb&#257;i touched the bullock with one of her
toes, and to the astonishment of all beholders, the animal at once got
up. Prithwi R&#257;j got rid of his leprosy by the favour of
R&#257;jb&#257;i, who granted him an additional boon that she would
come to help him on another occasion if he remembered her and sought
her assistance. R&#257;jb&#257;i then directed him to visit
Dw&#257;rk&#257;. Long after, king Prithwi R&#257;j, when he was at his
own place, remembered her in a moment of distress, and she went there
(in spirit) after giving instructions to her relatives not to dispose
of her body, as she would return soon. But the relatives did not
understand her, and before she had returned from Prithwi <span class=

body was disposed of according to the usual manner. For this,
R&#257;jb&#257;i cursed her relatives that one of their descendants in
each degree would turn out a lunatic. In her memory a pillar was raised
and an image set up, both of which are worshipped every morning and
evening. Milk, sugar and cakes are offered to her every morning in a
<i>th&#257;l</i> or dish, and milk and sugar every evening. There is a
festival in honour of R&#257;jb&#257;i during the Navar&#257;tra

S&#299;t&#257;. The ceremony of <i>&#257;rati</i> is performed before
the images five times every day. The first is called
<i>mangal&#257;rati</i> or the auspicious <i>&#257;rati</i> and is
performed early in the morning. The second is <i>Shang&#257;r
(Shring&#257;r) &#257;rati</i>, when night garments are taken off the
images and new ones are put on for the day. The third <i>R&#257;jbhog

are offered to the gods. The <i>Sandhy&#257; &#257;rati</i> follows the
offering of milk, sugar and cakes to the gods in the evening. The last,
<i>Pidh&#257;n &#257;rati</i>, is performed at night, when night
garments are substituted for the rich dresses of the day. There are

afflicted by diseases take a vow of presenting a <i>tav&#257;</i> (a
cake fried in oil in a pan). There is also a serpent-god named
Charmaria who receives an offering of <i>l&#257;psi</i> on every

from physical or mental afflictions. The attendant at the place is a
Brahman, and the worshippers of the M&#257;t&#257; visit her temple on
a Sunday or a Tuesday and offer sweetmeats or <i>l&#257;psi</i>. On the
eighth day of Ashvin a <i>havan</i> is made (<i>i.e.</i>, offerings are
burnt) before the goddess.<a class="noteref" id="n77.2src" href=

<p>Vows in honour of Khodiar M&#257;t&#257; are efficacious in the
prevention of such epidemics as cholera. The Khiyado M&#257;mo quells
evil spirits, <i>bh&#363;ts</i> and <i>prets</i>. The Khodo M&#257;mo
cures such diseases as cough and bronchitis. In the temple of

<p>Near the western gates of Zinzuwada is seen the celebrated shrine of
R&#257;jb&#257;i M&#257;t&#257;. In old times Zinzuwada was only the
<i>nehado</i><a class="noteref" id="n77.asrc" href="#n77.a" name=
"n77.asrc">62</a> of a Bharv&#257;d called Zunz&#257;. At that time the
queen of the reigning prince of P&#257;tan could not be delivered of a
child even though two years had passed since the time of conception.
Once while on tour the queen&rsquo;s party encamped near the
<i>nehado</i> of Zunz&#257; Bharv&#257;d. The latter, when he learnt of
the queen&rsquo;s misfortune, said that the co-wives of the queen had
bewitched her by the <i>k&#257;man</i> art, <i>i.e.</i>, by passing an
earthen pot round her and by burying the pot underground with a live
frog hanging with its head downwards in it. He added that the queen
would not be delivered unless the frog was brought out by some
stratagem. He asked the queen and her followers to stay there for some
time, and sent word to P&#257;tan with a messenger that the queen was
delivered of a son. The co-wives of the queen, dismayed at the
unexpected news and at the futility of the <i>k&#257;man</i> art, went
to look at the buried frog, which instantly jumped out and at the same
moment the pregnant queen gave birth to a son. As the child was brought
to birth by the instructions of a <i>Siddha-purusha</i> (a magician),
it was named Siddhar&#257;j. The town of Zinzuwada was built in memory
of Zunz&#257; Bharv&#257;d, and a temple of R&#257;jb&#257;i
M&#257;t&#257; was erected in honour of the queen. A large lake named
Sens&#257;sar was also constructed in memory of Sens&#257;, the brother
of Zunz&#257;.<a class="noteref" id="n77.3src" href="#n77.3" name=
"n77.3src">63</a></p>
<p>Soon afterwards people began to observe vows in honour of
R&#257;jb&#257;i M&#257;t&#257;. The devotees of the goddess visit her
temple every evening. All newly-married couples in the village offer
salutations to the M&#257;t&#257; accompanied by hired musicians and a
party of women who sing on the way to the shrine. A virgin walks in
front of the party with an earthen pot and a cocoanut on her head.
After the salutations, sweetmeats to the amount vowed for are
distributed among all those who are present. Sometimes a woman who has
observed vows for the sake of a son, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e7774" href="#xd26e7774" name="xd26e7774">78</a>]</span>presents a
silver umbrella to the goddess, of the value of one rupee and a quarter
or five rupees and a quarter, on the birth of a son to her. Burnt
offerings and <i>l&#257;psi</i> are presented to the goddess to protect
the town from such misfortunes as cholera, plague, etc.<a class=

<p>There is a well-known place called V&#257;chhd&#257;-solanki about
eight miles front Zinzuwada. Once a Rajput boy, aged sixteen, was going
round the marriage-altar at the time of his wedding, in the village of
Kuar, when he heard a piteous cry from a distressed cowherd, whose cows
were being carried away by freebooters. The boy immediately ran to
rescue the cows; but he was killed in the encounter. A temple was built
on that spot in his honour. There is a small <i>kund</i> near the
temple, the water in which is believed never to dry up and to possess
the quality of curing hydrophobia.</p>
<p>Goradia Hanum&#257;n lies three miles from Zinzuwada, and there is a
tradition that there is a treasure hidden near by. Many vows are
observed in honour of Dham&#257; Hanum&#257;n, whose place is at a
distance of two miles from Zinzuwada.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n78.1">64</a></p>
<p>The holy <i>kund</i> of Zil&#257;nand is one mile from Zinzuwada. It
is a custom of the neighbourhood to throw the bones of deceased persons
into this <i>kund</i>, and a fair is held annually at the place on the
last day of Bh&#257;drapad. The Bhot&#257;vo <i>kund</i> is one mile
distant from Zil&#257;nand <i>kund</i>: the bottom of this <i>kund</i>
presents a bluish appearance, and the water always remains hot. It is
said that there are sulphur mines below.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=

<p>A princess of Marwar used to worship five gods: Sumaria Ganesh,
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7816" title=
"Source: Kanaknath">Kanakn&#257;th</span>, Ratneshwar Mah&#257;dev,
N&#257;gn&#257;th and Hanum&#257;n; and she had taken a vow never to
take food before she had worshipped all of them. The gods followed her
everywhere in all her tours, but they had made one condition, that they
would stop if she looked behind at them on the way. The princess
happened to look back at Ganpati on the ridge of Sumaria near Keshia,
three miles to the east of Jodia. So Ganpati would not leave Sumaria,
and was installed there as Sumaria Ganesh. The same happened to
Ratneshwar near Badanpur; to Kanakn&#257;th, at a place midway between
Kanakpuri (the modern Kunad) and Badanpur; and to Hanum&#257;n, near
Kunad. In the same manner, N&#257;gn&#257;th was installed near the
Balambha gate of Jodia. The old town of Kanakpuri was buried by an
earth-quake, and the image Kunadia Hanum&#257;n was found among its
ruins.</p>
<p>The attendants of Sumaria Ganesh are At&#299;ts. A fair is held
there on the 4th day of Vaish&#257;kh, when thousands of Dheds flock to
the place. The usual offering to the god consists of sweet balls.
Kanakn&#257;th is attended upon by At&#299;t B&#257;v&#257;s who share
among themselves whatever is offered to the god. Shaivas hold a fair
here on the 8th day of the dark half of Shr&#257;van.</p>
<p>The devotees of Kunadia Hanum&#257;n observe <i>anagh</i> (vulgarly
called <i>anagodha</i>) at his place on Saturdays. They cook their food
there and make offerings to the god before partaking of it, fasting
afterwards for the day. The <i>anagh</i> is observed in the month of
M&#257;rgash&#299;rsha. The attendants of this god are Kh&#257;khi
B&#257;v&#257;s.<a class="noteref" id="n78.2src" href="#n78.2" name=

<p>One mile to the north-west of Jodia, towards the sea, there is a
stone image of a horse set up on a pedestal, known as R&#257;val
P&#299;r. A heroic Gir&#257;sia of the D&#257;l sect, named R&#257;val,
was once shipwrecked while on an expedition from Cutch, and is said to
have landed at the spot where R&#257;val P&#299;r stands at present. He
received a hearty reception at the hands of the then ruling prince of
Jodia (who was a Khav&#257;s) and was installed in the Durb&#257;r as
Nana R&#257;val P&#299;r.</p>
<p>On the second day of the bright half of &#256;sh&#257;dh (which is
the new year&rsquo;s day <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7839" href=
"#xd26e7839" name="xd26e7839">79</a>]</span>according to the Halari
year) Hindus offer <i>l&#257;psi</i> to R&#257;val P&#299;r as also on
each Monday in the month of Bh&#257;drapad. On occasions of popular
distress, such as the breaking out of cholera or when the rains stop
for days together, the <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e7845" title=
"Source: bhuw&#257;s">bhuv&#257;s</span></i> at the place, who are
D&#257;l Rajputs, receive the <i>pedi</i> (a small heap of
<i>l&#257;psi</i>) on behalf of the P&#299;r, and being possessed,
declare the will of the P&#299;r as to when rain may be expected or
when an epidemic will be warded off. Persons who are anxious for the
success of their undertakings observe vows in honour of the P&#299;r
which may cost them anything from a single pice to twenty-five rupees.
At the shrine of N&#257;n&#257; R&#257;val P&#299;r, huge kettledrums
are beaten and the ceremony of <i>&#257;rati</i> is performed every
morning and evening.<a class="noteref" id="n79.1src" href="#n79.1"

<p>The present site of Lilapur was formerly uninhabited, and the
village stood nearly one mile off. Once the goddess Bhav&#257;n&#299;
directed the <i>patel</i> of the village in a dream to reside on the
present site, and promised him that he would be always happy and that
none of his descendants for seven generations would die of cholera. In
testimony of the reality of the dream a box of red lac, a cocoanut, a
reel of red thread&mdash;called <i>n&#257;d&#257;s&#257;di</i> and
<i>chunadi</i>&mdash;were found under the patel&rsquo;s pillow. The
village was then removed to its present site. The descendants of the
patel are called Yadod&#257;. The M&#257;t&#257; chose to take a
Bharv&#257;d to be her attendant. On the 15th day of the bright half of
Shr&#257;van offerings are burnt before the M&#257;t&#257;, when the
attendant <i>bhuv&#257;</i> has to offer sweetmeats worth five rupees.
Every Bharv&#257;d family spends a rupee and a quarter every third year
in honour of the M&#257;t&#257;.</p>
<p>During the famine of the year 1895 Samvat era (= 1839 <span class=
"sc">A. D.</span>) the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> was thinking of leaving the
M&#257;t&#257; in order to escape from starvation, when the goddess
appeared in a dream to him, and told him that he would find half a
rupee every morning in the temple until he saw and partook of the new
harvest. In the month of Shr&#257;van, he happened to partake of some
new seeds and the coin could not be found as usual after this, although
the new harvest was not quite ready till three months afterwards. At
the entreaties of the <i>bhuv&#257;</i>, however, the M&#257;t&#257;
again told him in a dream that he would find a silver anklet, weighing
60 <i>tolas</i>, on the <i>bhogav&#257;</i> (village boundary) of the
village of Shiyani. A number of vows are observed in honour of this
goddess with various motives.<a class="noteref" id="n79.2src" href=
"#n79.2" name="n79.2src">67</a></p>
<p>The Shakta M&#257;t&#257; in the western part of the same village
prevents the Jogan&#299;s or female fiends from spreading contagious
diseases.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n79.2">67</a></p>
<p>The Surdhans near the gates of Lilapur represent two heroes who were
killed in an encounter with freebooters in the <i>Samvat</i> year 1836
(1780 <span class="sc">A. D.</span>). The knots of the marriage-scarves
of the descendants of the Surdhans are untied before them, and any of
their female descendants visiting the images without a veil on their
faces, are subjected to serious calamities.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n79.2">67</a></p>
<p>About ten years ago Un&#257;d Bhagat and Jiv&#257; Bhagat of Paliad
were one day walking together, when Un&#257;d Bhagat collected seven
stones and placing them one over the other, said to Jiv&#257; Bhagat
that he was constructing a <i>p&#257;lio</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a tomb for
Jiv&#257;. Immediately Jiv&#257; died, and Un&#257;d had to carry out
what was merely meant in jest. Some rooms are built at the expense of
the Jasdan Durbar, and a <i>puj&#257;ri</i> daily offers worship to
Jiv&#257; Bhagat. A fair is also held in his honour on the second day
of Bh&#257;drapad.<a class="noteref" id="n79.3src" href="#n79.3" name=
"n79.3src">68</a></p>
<p>About two miles from Jasdan in the village of Bakhalvad there is a
temple of &#256;vad M&#257;t&#257;. The latter represents the queen of
one of the rulers of Jasdan. On every Vijay&#257;-dasham&#299;,
<i>i.e.</i>, the 10th day of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e7932" href="#xd26e7932" name="xd26e7932">80</a>]</span>bright
half of Ashvin, the prince of Jasdan goes to visit the image in a
procession, offers <i>l&#257;psi</i> to &#256;vad M&#257;t&#257;, and
then a feast is celebrated. Formerly it was the custom to kill a
buffalo before the goddess on this day: but only <i>l&#257;psi</i> is
now offered instead. It is usual to take some wine also on this
occasion.<a class="noteref" id="n80.1src" href="#n80.1" name=
"n80.1src">69</a></p>
<p>On the Chitalia hill, two miles from Jasdan, there is a temple of
Shital&#257;, the goddess of small-pox, where children who have lately
recovered from that disease are taken to offer salutations to the
goddess. Silver images of human eye, milk, sugar, curds, grapes,
cocoanuts, a sheet of blank paper, and a number of other things are
presented to the goddess on such an occasion. Some persons vow to visit
the goddess with a burning hearth on their heads. Such vows are
discharged on a <i>s&#257;tem</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the 7th day of the
bright or the dark half of a month. On Shili S&#257;tem, the 7th day of
the dark half of Shr&#257;van, there is a large gathering of people at
the place.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n80.1">69</a></p>
<p>The village-gods of Upleta are Kaleshwar, Pragateshwar,
Somn&#257;th, N&#299;lkanth, D&#257;dmo and Khetalio. Pragateshwar is
said to have emerged from the earth of his own accord and is therefore
called <i>Swayambhu</i> (self-existent). The same is said about
N&#299;lkanth and Somn&#257;th also. The temple of D&#257;dmo lies a
little away from Upleta. Persons suffering from cough observe vows in
his honour and partake of parched gram. There is a <i>devi</i> near
Pragateshwar before whom a sacrifice is performed on the 9th day of the
bright half of Ashvin, and cakes, bread, <i>khichdi</i> and <i>khir</i>
are offered.<a class="noteref" id="n80.2src" href="#n80.2" name=

<p>In Gondal there is a temple of Gondalio N&#257;g and one of
N&#257;gn&#257;th Mah&#257;dev. Pure milk is the usual offering made to
both the deities. Gondalio N&#257;g is installed in Durb&#257;rgadh and
is white in appearance. Newly married couples of high class Hindus
untie the knots of their marriage-scarves before this deity. In the
Durb&#257;rgadh there are tombs of seven <i>ghoris</i> with whose
assistance the first king of Gondal is said to have won his crown.
There is also a family goddess of the Bhadeja Rajputs in Gondal known
as Ash&#257;puri, a vow in whose honour is believed to fulfil all
desires.<a class="noteref" id="n80.3src" href="#n80.3" name=

<p>There is a female spirit named Meldi in Movaiya who is worshipped by
<i>bhuv&#257;s</i> on the 14th day of the dark half of Ashv&#299;n. On
that day they heat oil in an iron pan and take out cakes from the
burning oil with unprotected hands. A goat and a cock are also
sacrificed on this occasion, and the meat is partaken of in order to
win the favour of the goddess.<a class="noteref" id="n80.4src" href=
"#n80.4" name="n80.4src">72</a></p>
<p>There is a <i>bed&#257;</i> tree near Movaiya about which the
following story is told. Long ago there was a <i>kanbi</i> (farmer) in
Movaiya who used to see a boy moving in front of him with an uncovered
head whenever he was ploughing his field. One day the <i>kanbi</i>
lopped off the hair from the boy&rsquo;s head who followed him to his
home, entreating him to return the lock of hair. The <i>kanbi</i>
however did not heed him, and concealed the lock of hair in a jar
containing gram. The boy then served the <i>kanbi</i> as a field-boy,
when one day he was asked by his master to take gram out of the jar for
sowing. The boy, who was a <i>bhut</i>, found his lock of hair there,
and when once he had obtained it, he took a very heavy load of gram to
the <i>kanbi</i> and bade him good-bye. But before the boy had fled
with his lock of hair, the <i>kanbi</i> begged of him a boon that a
<i>bed&#257;</i> tree should grow in his field, where vows could be
observed in honour of the <i>bhut</i>.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n80.4">72</a></p>
<p>The villagers in Sayala accompanied by several <i>bhuv&#257;s</i>
and by musicians who beat the <i>dhols</i> and the
<i>d&#257;nkl&#257;n</i> go outside the village <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8034" href="#xd26e8034" name=
"xd26e8034">81</a>]</span>to visit the temple of Khodi&#257;r
M&#257;t&#257; on the 15th day of the bright half of Shr&#257;van. The
<i>bhuv&#257;s</i> wind a piece of cotton-thread round the village, and
sometimes pour out milk or water in the same place in order to secure
its safety from any epidemic. On the same occasion four divers, who are
generally healthy young athletes, are presented with an earthen pot
each and are made to stand in the village-tank till the water reaches
to their necks. They are asked to dive simultaneously in the water at a
signal from the headman of the village, and to get out immediately.
Each of them is named after one of the four months of the rainy season
and the amount of water in the pot of each is supposed to indicate the
amount of rain which would fall in the respective months of the next
year. After leaving the water the divers break the pots on the spot,
and the fragments are taken away by the people, to be kept in their
jars of corn, in the belief that they will bring prosperity in the
ensuing season. The four divers are then made to run a race on the
<i>maidan</i>, and he who wins the race gets a small plough and a
cocoanut as a prize. The winner is called <i>h&#257;lino-jityo</i>, and
it is believed that he will be successful in all his undertakings.</p>
<p>On the same day the <i>bhuv&#257;s</i> place a small four-wheeled
chariot of the M&#257;t&#257; outside the village, and it is believed
that the chariot carries off the plague, cholera and similar diseases
with it. Such ceremonies are performed in most of the villages on the
Balev holiday (<i>i.e.</i>, the N&#257;rel-Purnim&#257; day, or the
15th day of the bright half of Shr&#257;van).<a class="noteref" id=
"n81.1src" href="#n81.1" name="n81.1src">73</a></p>
<p>The foundation of a new settlement is carried out in various ways. A
series of unusual accidents befalling the residents of a village makes
them doubtful of the security of their residence, and produces a desire
to move to a safer home. Very often on such occasions the
<i>bhuv&#257;s</i> or exorcists are possessed by the Devis, or
M&#257;t&#257;s, and declare the will of the gods regarding a new
settlement. Sometimes a change of home is recommended <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e8062" title="Source: tot he">to the</span> villagers in
a dream: sometimes a heavenly voice is said to direct the change, in
addressing one of the villagers.<a class="noteref" id="n81.2src" href=
"#n81.2" name="n81.2src">74</a></p>
<p>An astrologer has first to be consulted as to the auspicious date on
which the boundaries of the new settlement should be marked out. Three
or four days before the delimitation, learned Brahmans are sent to
purify the chosen site by the recitation of sacred mantras.<a class=
"noteref" id="n81.3src" href="#n81.3" name="n81.3src">75</a> On the
appointed day the headman of the village leads a procession to the
site, and performs the ceremony of installing the village gods. It is
said that, at the time of founding a new settlement, it is necessary to
install and worship the <i>panch-deva</i> or the five deities, namely,
Hanum&#257;n, Ganpati, Mah&#257;dev, Vishnu and Devi. Hanum&#257;n is
installed at the village-gates, and is propitiated with an offering of
<i>churmu</i> and <i>vad&#257;n</i>. The images of Ganpati and Vishnu
are set up in a central place in the village, temples being built for
them in due curse. Mah&#257;dev is generally installed on the
village-boundary, and has a temple built for him afterwards. Devi may
be set up anywhere: her installation is not permanent nor does she
receive systematic worship.<a class="noteref" id="n81.4src" href=
"#n81.4" name="n81.4src">76</a> But more generally only Ganpati,
Hanum&#257;n and M&#257;t&#257; are installed on this
occasion.<a class="noteref" id="n81.5src" href="#n81.5" name=
"n81.5src">77</a> Occasionally other deities, such as the Earth, Shesh
N&#257;g,<a class="noteref" id="n81.asrc" href="#n81.a" name=
"n81.asrc">78</a> the Navagrah (the nine planets), the pole-star and
Kshetrap&#257;l are also worshipped.<a class="noteref" id="n81.6src"
href="#n81.6" name="n81.6src">79</a></p>
<p>The village-gates are fixed after the ceremony of installation, and
a <i>tora&#7751;</i>&mdash;a string of <i>&#257;sop&#257;lav</i> leaves
(Jonesia asoka) with a cocoanut in the centre&mdash;is fastened across
them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8104" href="#xd26e8104" name=
"xd26e8104">82</a>]</span>near the top.<a class="noteref" id="n82.1src"
href="#n82.1" name="n82.1src">80</a> Here the ceremony of
<i>kh&#257;t-muhurt</i><a class="noteref" id="n82.asrc" href="#n82.a"
name="n82.asrc">81</a> is performed<a class="noteref" id="n82.2src"
href="#n82.2" name="n82.2src">82</a> and afterwards the headman,
accompanied by a Brahman, who recites mantras, either winds a
cotton-thread besmeared with red lac round the village or pours a
stream of milk <i>dh&#257;r&#257;v&#257;di</i> along the village
boundaries.<a class="noteref" id="n82.3src" href="#n82.3" name=
"n82.3src">83</a> The headman has further to perform the <i>homa</i> at
the gates of the village, when a company of Brahmans recite holy
passages in honour of Hanum&#257;n and M&#257;t&#257;. At the time of
the completion of the homa, when the <i>&#257;huti</i> (an oblation of
ghi) is thrown on the fire, all persons present offer cocoanuts to the
sacrificial fire.<a class="noteref" id="n82.4src" href="#n82.4" name=
"n82.4src">84</a></p>
<p>In some places it is usual to worship the newly chosen site itself,
and then to drive into the ground a wooden peg besmeared with red lac,
called the <i>khili</i> (peg) of Shesh N&#257;g, which is first
ceremoniously worshipped with red lac, sandal-ointment and
rice.<a class="noteref" id="n82.5src" href="#n82.5" name=
"n82.5src">85</a></p>
<p>After these ceremonies, the villagers are at liberty to build their
own houses within the new settlement. When the houses are complete and
ready for habitation, it is necessary to perform the ceremony known as
<i>v&#257;stun</i> (or <i>graha-sh&#257;nti</i>) for the propitiation
of the nine planets. Both the day of installing the gods and the day of
<i>v&#257;stun</i> ceremony, are observed as festivals, at which
Brahmans are feasted, and <i>l&#257;psi</i>, <i>churmu</i> and
<i>kans&#257;r</i> are offered to the gods.<a class="noteref" id=
"n82.6src" href="#n82.6" name="n82.6src">86</a></p>
<p>The new settlement may be named after the deity whose advice brought
about the move or after the headman. It is sometimes named after the
particular incident which drove the people to seek their new
home.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n82.6">86</a></p>
<p>A failure of the harvest is in most cases due to the irregularity of
the rains. It is therefore ascribed to the displeasure of Indra, the
god of rain, and Varuna, the god of water. The mode of propitiating
these gods has already been described.</p>
<p>Sometimes a cessation of rains is attributed to the wrath of the
village-gods, whereupon the festival of <i>Uj&#257;&#7751;i</i> is
celebrated in order to appease them. One day, preferably a Sunday, all
the inhabitants go outside the village, and rich viands are cooked to
be offered to the village-gods. At the same time, the headman performs
a <i>homa</i> sacrifice and the dainties are partaken of after the
villagers have thrown cocoanuts into the sacrificial fire.</p>
<p>In similar circumstances people sometimes seek the protection of the
gods Annadeva, Annap&#363;r&#7751;&#257;, and Kriy&#257; Bhaudai. Six
<i>dokd&#257;s</i><a class="noteref" id="n82.bsrc" href="#n82.b" name=
"n82.bsrc">87</a> or six pice are collected from every house in the
village to make what is called a <i>chhakadi</i>, and the whole amount
is then bestowed in charity in the name of the above-named
deities.<a class="noteref" id="n82.7src" href="#n82.7" name=

"noteref" id="n82.csrc" href="#n82.c" name="n82.csrc">89</a> is

either by offering dainties or a goat or a ram, or by the observance of
<i>Uj&#257;&#7751;i</i>. A <i>dh&#257;r&#257;v&#257;di</i>&mdash;a
stream of milk&mdash;is poured on to the ground adjoining the village

temple.<a class="noteref" id="n83.1src" href="#n83.1" name=

<p>Small-pox is supposed to be the result of the displeasure of the
goddess Shital&#257;. In all cases of small-pox the victim is left to
suffer, the only remedy being the observation of vows in honour of the
angry goddess. Different things are dedicated to the goddess according
as the disease affects one part of the body or another; and they are
usually offered on a Sunday or a Tuesday. The usual offering consists
of <i>kulera</i>,<a class="noteref" id="n83.asrc" href="#n83.a" name=
"n83.asrc">96</a> a <i>t&#257;v</i> (a sheet of paper), fried

the symptoms.<a class="noteref" id="n83.3src" href="#n83.3" name=

<p><i>Kharav&#257;</i> affects the hoofs of cattle, in which it

<p>Sometimes the paper on which the <i>jantra</i> is written is placed
in a hollow bamboo stick which is then fastened over the
gates.<a class="noteref" id="n83.6src" href="#n83.6" name=

<p><i>Muv&#257;-keshibi</i> causes saliva to flow continuously from the
mouths of animals. A <i>gagarbediun</i> (a piece of leather thong or a
piece of black wood, on which magic spells have been cast) is suspended
over the village gates or is tied to the neck of the animal, in the
case of this disease occurring.<a class="noteref" id="n83.7src" href=
"#n83.7" name="n83.7src">103</a></p>
<p>In such diseases as <i>kharav&#257;</i>, <i>sunaku</i>,
<i>motudukh</i> (lit. the great malady), <i>valo</i>,
<i>pet-tod</i>,<a class="noteref" id="n83.dsrc" href="#n83.d" name=

tied by a piece of indigo-coloured cloth or by a piece of thread of the
same colour, round the neck of the animal, and is also fastened over
the village-gates. A <i>tora&#7751;</i> is prepared of the ears of
<i>juv&#257;ri</i> corn with a cocoanut in the centre, and after
magical incantations have been pronounced over it, is suspended over
the village-gates. All animals passing under the <i>tora&#7751;</i> are
believed to be proof against the disease. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e8413" href="#xd26e8413" name="xd26e8413">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>But if this is not successful in checking the course of the disease,
it is usual to swallow the <i>chelans</i><a class="noteref" id=
"n84.asrc" href="#n84.a" name="n84.asrc">106</a> of Mungi
M&#257;t&#257; (the Dumb Mother). For this purpose the
<i>bhuv&#257;s</i> of the M&#257;t&#257;, who are Bharv&#257;ds, are
invited to the stalls of the affected cattle, where they recite magic
incantations amidst tumultuous shouts and yells. After this they are
fed with rice, ghi and sugar, this latter process being called
&lsquo;swallowing the <i>chelans</i> of the
M&#257;t&#257;.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="n84.1src" href="#n84.1"
name="n84.1src">107</a></p>
<p>In event of this process being of no avail in restraining the
disease, the headman of the village in the company of his wife performs
a <i>homa</i> sacrifice in the places dedicated to the M&#257;t&#257;s,
and offers an <i>&#257;huti</i>&mdash;a sacrificial oblation&mdash;when
all the villagers dedicate cocoanuts to the sacrificial fire.<a class=
"noteref" id="n84.2src" href="#n84.2" name="n84.2src">108</a></p>
<p>Sometimes the wrath of the god Gorakhdev is supposed to be
responsible for cattle-diseases. A bunch of the leaves of a poisonous
medicinal plant <i>&#257;nkdo</i> is passed seven times over the body
of the ailing animal with the prayer &lsquo;May Gorakhdev be
pleased,&rsquo; and a cocoanut is dedicated to the god.<a class=
"noteref" id="n84.3src" href="#n84.3" name="n84.3src">109</a></p>
<p>Another method of checking cattle-disease is to bury the corpse of
an animal which has died thereof near the village-gates. It is believed
that this puts a stop to any further deaths among cattle from the same
disease.<a class="noteref" id="n84.4src" href="#n84.4" name=
"n84.4src">110</a></p>
<p>When such a disease as <i>shili</i> (small-pox), <i>sakharado</i>,
or <i>kharav&#257;</i> prevails largely among cattle, a belief gains
ground that the Dheds (who flay the dead cattle and sell their hides)
have poisoned the drinking water of the cattle in order to increase
their earnings.<a class="noteref" id="n84.5src" href="#n84.5" name=
"n84.5src">111</a></p>
<p>The god K&#257;l-bhairav was brought into existence by the fury of
god Shiva, when he, being extremely angry with Brahm&#257;, cut off the
fifth head of the latter. K&#257;l-bhairav is the leader of all
<i>bhuts</i> (ghosts) and <i>d&#257;kans</i> (witches), and resides at
K&#257;shi (Benares) by the order of Shiva. His favourite haunt is a
cemetery. His image is always represented as fierce and ugly.<a class=
"noteref" id="n84.6src" href="#n84.6" name="n84.6src">112</a></p>
<p>It is said that this god once entered the mouth of Gorakhnath and
performed religious austerities in that strange abode. Although
Gorakhnath was nearly suffocated, he could only persuade <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e8490" title=
"Source: Kal-bhairav">K&#257;l-bhairav</span> to come out by extolling
his glory and by conferring on him the leadership of all <i>bhuts</i>
and the guardianship of the Kotv&#257;lu fortress at
K&#257;shi.<a class="noteref" id="n84.7src" href="#n84.7" name=
"n84.7src">113</a></p>
<p>K&#257;l-bhairav does not command worship on any auspicious
occasion. On the other hand, he is much revered by persons who practise
the black art. On <i>K&#257;li-chaudas</i> day his devotees worship him
in a cemetery, offer an oblation of <i>baklan</i>, and recite magic
incantations till late at night.<a class="noteref" id="n84.8src" href=

<p>The offerings favoured by K&#257;l-bhairav are <i>khir</i>,<a class=

<p>(I worship K&#257;l-bhairav, the giver of food and of salvation, of
auspicious and comely appearance, who is kind to his devotees.)</p>
<p>Ganpati or Ganesh, about whose origin the traditional legends
prevail, is represented with four hands, in one of which he holds a
<i>kamandalu</i> (a gourd), in the second a <i>l&#257;du</i> (or a
sweet-ball), in the third a <i>parashu</i> (or an axe), and in the
fourth a <i>jap-m&#257;l</i> (or a rosary). He is sometimes called
Dundalo (lit., big-bellied) because of his having a protuberant belly.
He puts on a yellow garment and rides a mouse. His brother is
K&#257;rtik-sw&#257;m&#299; who rides a peacock. His favourite dish
consists of <i>l&#257;dus</i> or sweet-balls of wheat-flour fried in
ghi and sweetened with molasses. Siddhi and Buddhi are the two wives of
Ganpati. Before their marriage their father Vishwarupa had made a
promise that he would bestow the hands of both on whomsoever
circumambulated the whole Earth within one day. Ganpati reasoned that a
cow and a mother are equal in merit to the Earth and by passing round
the former, he got the hands of both. Ganpati is said to be the fastest
writer of all, so that the sage Vy&#257;sa secured his services as a
scribe, at the instance of Brahm&#257;, in writing the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rat. When R&#257;van had conquered all the gods and
made them serve in his household, Ganpati had to become a cowherd and
to look after cows and goats.<a class="noteref" id="n85.2src" href=
"#n85.2" name="n85.2src">121</a></p>
<p>On <i>Vaish&#257;kh sud choth</i>, known as Ganpati <i>choth</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, the fourth day of the bright half of Vaish&#257;kh,
Ganpati is ceremoniously worshipped with red lead, red flowers, milk,
curds, honey, etc. The image of the god is besmeared with red lead and
ghi, and the remnant of this ointment is applied to the doors and
windows of the house.<a class="noteref" id="n85.3src" href="#n85.3"
name="n85.3src">122</a> Sweet-balls of wheat-flour fried in ghi and
sweetened with molasses are first dedicated to Ganpati and are
afterwards partaken of as the god&rsquo;s gift.<a class="noteref" id=
"n85.4src" href="#n85.4" name="n85.4src">123</a></p>
<p>The people of Mah&#257;r&#257;shtra observe Ganpati <i>choth</i> on
the 4th day of the bright half of <i>Bh&#257;drapad</i>, when an
earthen image of Ganpati is made and worshipped with twenty kinds of
leaves.<a class="noteref" id="n85.5src" href="#n85.5" name=
"n85.5src">124</a></p>
<p>It is a custom among the Vaishnavas to draw an image of Ganpati in
those vessels which are to be used for cooking food at the time of
performing the obsequies of a deceased Vaishnava.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The M&#257;trik&#257;s are sixteen in number, and are worshipped on
such auspicious occasions as a <i>yajna</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, a sacrifice),
a wedding, or the ceremony known as <i>v&#257;stu</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="n85.7src" href="#n85.7" name="n85.7src">126</a> Their

<p class="first">The marks are besmeared with molasses, and a little
ghi and a piece of some precious metal is affixed to them.<a class=
"noteref" id="n85.8src" href="#n85.8" name="n85.8src">127</a> At the
time of a marriage, fourteen are worshipped in the house, one outside

<p>The M&#257;trik&#257;s or M&#257;t&#257;s are worshipped during the
Navar&#257;tra holidays also. On this occasion small <i>morias</i> or
earthen bowls with a hole in the centre of each, are plastered with
<i>khadi</i> (red or green earth) and <i>k&#257;y&#257;</i>; and young
girls carry them on their heads with burning lamps from door to door.
At each house they receive oil for the lamp and a handful of corn. On
the last day, <i>i.e.</i>, on the ninth day, all the bowls are placed
on the special site dedicated to the M&#257;t&#257;s. The songs, which
are also accompanied by dancing, are called <i>garabi</i> or
<i>garab&#257;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n86.1src" href="#n86.1" name=
"n86.1src">129</a></p>
<p>The M&#257;trik&#257;s are also supposed to be the <i>grahas</i> or
planets which influence the life of a child in the womb, and their
worship is believed to bring about an easy delivery.<a class="noteref"
id="n86.2src" href="#n86.2" name="n86.2src">130</a></p>
<p>There is also a family goddess of the name of M&#257;trik&#257;. In
worshipping her, seven round spots are painted on a wall with red lac,
and ghi is poured over them in such a manner as to form five small
<i>rel&#257;s</i> (streams). A mixture of molasses and ghi is then
applied to these spots with a piece of <i>&#257;d&#257;chh</i> (red
cotton yarn). By this process the devotee secures the motherly regard
of the goddess.<a class="noteref" id="n86.3src" href="#n86.3" name=
"n86.3src">131</a></p>
<p>One of the deities which preside over child-birth is Randal
M&#257;t&#257; or Rann&#257; Devi, who is said to be the wife of the
Sun.<a class="noteref" id="n86.4src" href="#n86.4" name=
"n86.4src">132</a> In order to secure an easy delivery, pregnant women
take a vow that they will invite one or more <i>lot&#257;s</i> (bowls)
of this M&#257;t&#257;. The process of &ldquo;inviting the
<i>lot&#257;s</i>&rdquo; is as <span class="corr" id="xd26e8729" title=
"Source: follow">follows</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>The tufts round the shell of a cocoanut are pulled out, the nut is
besmeared with chalk, and marks representing two eyes and a nose are
painted on it. (Or the nut is so placed that the two spots on its
surface represent eyes, and the pointed tuft of fibres between them
serves the purpose of a nose). A bowl is placed on a piece of cloth
stretched on a wooden stool, and the cocoanut is placed over the bowl.
It is then dressed in elegant female attire, and a ghi lamp is kept
constantly burning near it. This completes the <i>sth&#257;pan</i> or
installation of Randal M&#257;t&#257;. Women bow down before this
representation of the M&#257;t&#257;, and sing melodious tunes in its
presence. On the morning of the following day, the image is carried to
the temple of the village M&#257;t&#257;, the cocoanut is deposited
there, and the garments are brought home. The cocoanut is <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e8737" title="Source: subsquently">subsequently</span>
taken by the Brahman attendant of the M&#257;t&#257;.</p>
<p>On the day of the installation it is customary to invite five
<i>gor&#257;&#7751;is</i><a class="noteref" id="n86.asrc" href="#n86.a"
name="n86.asrc">133</a> (married women whose husbands are living) to a
feast of <i>khir</i> and cakes. On the next day, when the
M&#257;t&#257; is sent away, three virgins are entertained with rice,
sugar and milk.<a class="noteref" id="n86.5src" href="#n86.5" name=
"n86.5src">134</a></p>
<p>In some communities a custom prevails of &ldquo;inviting the
<i>lot&#257;s</i> of the M&#257;t&#257;s&rdquo; on the occasion of the
first pregnancy of a woman. On the day on which the <i>lot&#257;s</i>
are to be invited, the pregnant woman takes a bath early in the
morning, and calls upon thirteen <i>gor&#257;&#7751;is</i>, whom she
invites to dinner by marking their foreheads with red lac. A
Br&#257;hman is called to set up the M&#257;t&#257;s, whose
installation takes place in the same manner as that of Randal. The
piece of cloth spread on the wooden stool is required to be green. When
the <i>gor&#257;&#7751;is</i> sit down to the dinner, the pregnant
woman washes their right toes with milk and swallows that milk as
<i>charan&#257;mrit</i> (lit. the nectar of the feet). The
<i>gor&#257;&#7751;is</i> are required to taste a morsel of some
preparation of milk before they begin their meal. At night, a company
of women dance in a circle round the M&#257;t&#257;s, singing songs.
Next morning a <i>bhuv&#257;</i> is called, who declares the will of
the M&#257;t&#257;s. On receiving a satisfactory reply from the
<i>bhuv&#257;</i>, the party disperses.<a class="noteref" id="n86.6src"
href="#n86.6" name="n86.6src">135</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>The goddesses Bahuchar&#257;ji (or Bechr&#257;ji) and Amb&#257;ji
are sometimes worshipped for the sake of safety during childbirth. The
ceremony of N&#257;ndi-Shr&#257;ddha which was performed when R&#257;ma
was born is sometimes gone through at the birth of a child.<a class=

<p>The deities of the forest reside in groves of trees or near the

their vows.<a class="noteref" id="n87.2src" href="#n87.2" name=

they are noted for the cure of certain diseases, and the groves which

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Such diseases as cholera and small-pox are believed to
be brought on by the wrath of the M&#257;t&#257;s or Devis caused by
neglecting to offer the usual oblations. In order to propitiate them,
Br&#257;hmans are engaged to recite the <i>Chandip&#257;th</i> and to
offer <i>havans</i> (sacrificial offerings). Very often the festival
known as <i>ujani</i> is observed, in which all the villagers go
outside the village to take their meals, and return home in the evening
after witnessing the <i>&#257;huti</i> (the offering of cocoanuts to
the sacrificial fire).<a class="noteref" id="n88.asrc" href="#n88.a"
name="n88.asrc">1</a></p>
<p>Another belief personifies the diseases as <i>malin</i> or evil
spirits who are fond of human prey. To ward them off, a
<i>dh&#257;r&#257;-v&#257;di</i>, or stream of milk, is poured out in
the village or a magic thread is passed round. The chariot<a class=
"noteref" id="n88.bsrc" href="#n88.b" name="n88.bsrc">2</a> of the
M&#257;t&#257; is driven through the village with the same
object.<a class="noteref" id="n88.1src" href="#n88.1" name=
"n88.1src">3</a></p>
<p>There is a popular tradition that in ancient times cholera was
subjugated by king Vikrama, and was buried underground. Once upon a
time the British excavated the place in the belief that treasure was
concealed there, and thus cholera was released. After many soldiers had
fallen victims, the disease deity was at last propitiated by an
oblation, and was handed over to the Bhangis (or
scavengers)<span class="corr" id="xd26e8863" title=
"Not in source">.</span><a class="noteref" id="n88.2src" href="#n88.2"
name="n88.2src">4</a></p>
<p>This association of the Bhangis with cholera is present in most of
the beliefs current about the disease. There is a story that once upon
a time a number of students had put up in a house by which a Bhangi was
in the habit of passing frequently. He daily used to hear the students
reciting the sacred texts and this produced in his mind the desire to
become a Sanskrit scholar. For this purpose, having concealed his low
birth, he went to Benares and by diligent study, soon became a
<i>pandit</i>. He even married a girl of high caste. But his imposture
being at last discovered, he burnt himself to death, and his ashes gave
rise to the disease known as cholera.<a class="noteref" id="n88.3src"
href="#n88.3" name="n88.3src">5</a></p>
<p>At the present day, if the epidemic breaks out, the Bhangis are
often suspected in some way or other of having brought it about. It is
said that they make statues of the flour of <i>adad</i> (phaseolus
radiatus) and after piercing them with needles and pins, either throw
them into the wells which are daily used by the villagers<a class=
"noteref" id="n88.csrc" href="#n88.c" name="n88.csrc">6</a> or bury
them in a spot over which the people frequently pass. The whole affair
is managed very secretly and at the dead of night. The slightest rumour
of such proceedings causes a tumult in the village, and the Bhangis are
then in danger of being severely handled by the enraged
villagers.<a class="noteref" id="n88.4src" href="#n88.4" name=
"n88.4src">7</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8890" href=
"#xd26e8890" name="xd26e8890">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another method by which the Bhangis are supposed to bring about
cholera is to sprinkle the blood of a black cow on the image of
Hanum&#257;n. The god is deeply offended at the insult, and in
consequence spreads cholera in the neighbourhood. For this reason,
offerings are burnt before Hanum&#257;n in order to stop an epidemic of
cholera.<a class="noteref" id="n89.1src" href="#n89.1" name=
"n89.1src">8</a></p>
<p>Bhangis are also supposed by some to accomplish the same result by
the help of <i>malin</i> or evil deities who are first gratified by the
offering of victims.<a class="noteref" id="n89.2src" href="#n89.2"
name="n89.2src">9</a> One of such deities is R&#257;mdepir, to whom
<i>bali-d&#257;n</i> (offering of a victim) is made by the people,
through the medium of Bhangis, for the prevention of cholera.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n89.2">9</a></p>
<p>An outbreak of cholera offers a good opportunity to the Bhangis, who
extort dainties and small sums of money from the people. Persons
attacked by cholera often seek the services of a Bhangi and promise him
liberal gifts if they are cured. The latter generally treats his
patients by tying a magical thread round their elbows.<a class=
"noteref" id="n89.3src" href="#n89.3" name="n89.3src">10</a></p>
<p>It is said that the Bhangis have to present an offering to their
<i>malin</i> or evil goddess every third year, and that, in so doing,
they kill a black animal before the goddess. They then place an iron
pan full of sesamum oil on the fire, and suspend the body of the animal
above it. It is believed that as many human beings will fall victims to
cholera as the number of the drops of blood that fall from the body of
the animal into the iron pan.<a class="noteref" id="n89.4src" href=
"#n89.4" name="n89.4src">11</a></p>
<p>Another deity whose wrath is supposed to be responsible for the
breaking out of cholera is Mah&#257;m&#257;ri Devi.<a class="noteref"
id="n89.5src" href="#n89.5" name="n89.5src">12</a> The worshippers of
this goddess are Bhangis. She is believed to send forth cholera when
her oblations are stopped,<a class="noteref" id="n89.6src" href=
"#n89.6" name="n89.6src">13</a> and her favour is regained by renewing
the offer of these oblations. Sometimes the <i>Navachandi</i> sacrifice
is performed at the principal village-gates, and the
<i>chandip&#257;th</i> is recited at the other gates. A number of
Br&#257;hmans and virgins are also feasted, and presented with
garments. A magic cotton thread is passed round the village and a
<i>dh&#257;r&#257;-v&#257;di</i>, or stream of milk, is poured out. The
<i>bhuv&#257;s</i> go round the village playing upon the harsh
unpleasant <i>danklan</i>. A goat is then taken to the temple of the
M&#257;t&#257;, and the <i>bhuv&#257;s</i>, after cutting out its
tongue, dip their hands in its blood and strike them against the doors
of the temple. The goat is then killed and <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e8951" title="Source: Similar">similar</span> blood-marks are made
upon every door in the village as well as on the village-gates, where
an iron nail is driven into the ground with an incantation. A lime is
then cut, and an oblation is offered to the M&#257;t&#257;. Such a
process is believed to stop the progress of the epidemic.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n89.6">13</a></p>
<p>Other deities connected in popular belief with cholera are the
goddesses Visuchik&#257;<a class="noteref" id="n89.7src" href="#n89.7"
name="n89.7src">14</a> and Chandik&#257;.<a class="noteref" id=
"n89.8src" href="#n89.8" name="n89.8src">15</a> Visuchik&#257; is
conciliated by burnt offerings: the recitation of the
<i>chandip&#257;th</i> wins the favour of Chandik&#257;. There is also
a giantess named Karkat&#257; who is supposed to be responsible for
cholera. She is said to have sprung from the sweat on the forehead of
Brahm&#257; and to reside in the <i>chandra mandal</i> (or lunar
sphere).<a class="noteref" id="n89.9src" href="#n89.9" name=
"n89.9src">16</a></p>
<p>One of the remedies adopted to stop an epidemic of cholera is to
propitiate Shiva by the performance of <i>Rudray&#257;g</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="n89.asrc" href="#n89.a" name="n89.asrc">17</a>
<i>Mah&#257;rudra</i>,<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n89.a">17</a>

<p>Small-pox is believed to be the act of the goddess Shital&#257;
M&#257;t&#257;, who spreads the disease whenever she is desirous of
having victims.<a class="noteref" id="n90.4src" href="#n90.4" name=
"n90.4src">21</a> Thus, in cases of small-pox, the patient very often
receives no medical treatment, the only remedies adopted being directed
towards the propitiation of the M&#257;t&#257;.<a class="noteref" id=
"n90.asrc" href="#n90.a" name="n90.asrc">22</a> A number of vows are
taken in the M&#257;t&#257;&rsquo;s name, to be fulfilled after the
patient has recovered. Many people accomplish their vows before the
Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257; at Kalavad in J&#257;mnagar. A vow to visit
this place after the patient&rsquo;s recovery, and to abstain from
certain things till the day of the visit, is taken by the mother of the
affected person in case of a severe attack. But almost every village
contains a temple of Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257;, and those, who cannot
go to Kalavad, vow in the name of the local M&#257;t&#257;.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n90.4">21</a> One of such vows is to go to the
temple of the M&#257;t&#257; with a burning hearth on the
head.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n90.4">21</a> Such a vow is
generally undertaken by the patient&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>Ordinarily in a case of small-pox, the patient is not allowed to
bathe till he is completely free from all traces of the disease. A bath
is then given on a Sunday, a Tuesday, or a Thursday, with water which
has been heated by being placed in the sun. An image of Shital&#257;
M&#257;t&#257; is set up in the house near the water room, and the
patient worships the image after the bath. The image is drawn in
cowdung with two cotton seeds to represent the eyes. An offering of
<i>kulera</i><a class="noteref" id="n90.bsrc" href="#n90.b" name=
"n90.bsrc">23</a> and curds is made to the goddess. Five virgins are
invited to dinner, and are served with cold food. All the members of
the household also partake of cold food. On the 7th or the 13th day of
the bright half of a month the patient is taken to the temple of
Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257;, when a cocoanut is broken in the presence
of the goddess. Half of the cocoanut is brought home, the other half
being carried away by the M&#257;t&#257;&rsquo;s attendant. Some people
place a new earthen vessel filled with water near the goddess. Silver
eyes, which may be worth anything between half an anna and half a
rupee, are dedicated to the M&#257;t&#257;.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n90.4">21</a></p>
<p>The first visit to the M&#257;t&#257; should take place on a Sunday
or a Tuesday. The things vowed to the goddess are dedicated on this
occasion. It is also necessary to go to the goddess again on the next
Tuesday or Thursday after the first visit. This time only water and red
lac are offered.<a class="noteref" id="n90.5src" href="#n90.5" name=
"n90.5src">24</a></p>
<p>During the course of the disease no low-caste person and no woman in
her monthly course is allowed to cast his or her shadow on the
patient.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n90.4">21</a> The women in the
house are prohibited from combing their hair, or churning curdled milk,
or indulging in sexual intercourse. Such acts are believed to cause
extreme displeasure to the M&#257;t&#257;, who then causes some limb of
the patient to be affected. Branches of <i>nimb</i> leaves are
suspended over the doors of the house, and also round the
patient&rsquo;s bed. The same leaves are used to fan the
patient.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n90.4">21</a> <span class=

<p>When a child suffers from the disease, it is often weighed against
dates, which are first dedicated to the goddess, and then distributed
amongst the poor.<a class="noteref" id="n91.1src" href="#n91.1" name=
"n91.1src">25</a> The child is taken to bow down before the goddess
after nine or ten days from the date of attack, and the mother of the
child offers several things to the M&#257;t&#257;, among which are
grapes, sugar, a pinch of flour, a small earthen bowl full of water,
and a blank sheet of paper.<a class="noteref" id="n91.2src" href=
"#n91.2" name="n91.2src">26</a></p>
<p>Different things are dedicated to the goddess according as the
disease affects one part of the body or another. For instance, flour of
<i>b&#257;jr&#257;</i> or <i>juv&#257;ri</i> is offered in case of
bronchitis; silver models of the human eye when the disease affects the
eyes; a <i>goras</i> (a black earthen vessel full of curds) in case of
morbid heat; a piece of black paper, in high fever, and salt if there
is an itching sensation.<a class="noteref" id="n91.3src" href="#n91.3"
name="n91.3src">27</a> The M&#257;t&#257; is said to live on cold food
and to be very fond of things which have a cooling effect such as
fruits, sugar, etc. The same things are given to the patient as
food.<a class="noteref" id="n91.4src" href="#n91.4" name=
"n91.4src">28</a></p>
<p>To secure the protection of Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257; for their
children, women annually observe the vow of <i>shili s&#257;tem</i> on
the 7th day of the dark half of <i>Shr&#257;van</i>. On this day the
M&#257;t&#257; is said to visit every house and to roll herself on the
hearth. No fire is, therefore, lighted in the hearth on this day: for
if the M&#257;t&#257; comes and is scorched by the fire she is sure to
bring misfortune on that household. For this reason, a number of
dainties and all the food necessary for the day is prepared on the
previous day. On the day of <i>shili s&#257;tem</i>, <i>juv&#257;ri</i>
seeds are spread on the hearth, and after being sprinkled with red lac,
a cowdung bowl containing a plant called <i>va&#7751;a</i> is placed
upon them. The women of the house bathe with cold water and take only
one meal during the day. They further abstain from sewing and
embroidering during that day. Sometimes a Br&#257;hman is engaged to
recite the <i>Shital&#257; shloka</i> from a book called
Rudray&#257;mal.<a class="noteref" id="n91.5src" href="#n91.5" name=
"n91.5src">29</a></p>
<p>The following legend is related of <i>shili s&#257;tem</i>. A
certain woman once forgot to extinguish the fire in her hearth on
<i>R&#257;ndhan Chhetha</i> (lit. cooking sixth), <i>i.e.</i>, the day
previous to <i>shili s&#257;tem</i>. On the next day, the
M&#257;t&#257; was scorched in the stomach when she came to roll
herself on the hearth. In extreme anger the goddess cursed the woman
saying that her only son would be burnt to death; and immediately the
boy died. In her anguish the unfortunate mother confessed her fault to
a friend, who advised her to go to the jungle and entreat the
M&#257;t&#257; to give back her son. She found the goddess rolling in
distress under a <i>b&#257;bul</i> tree. The woman slowly approached
her, and began to comb out the M&#257;t&#257;&rsquo;s hair. She then
placed her son in the M&#257;t&#257;&rsquo;s lap and entreated the
goddess to revive the boy. The M&#257;t&#257; felt much relieved by the
woman&rsquo;s attentions and blessed her saying that her bosom should
be as quiet as her own head. Immediately, at these words, the boy
revived, to the intense joy of his mother.<a class="noteref" id=
"n91.6src" href="#n91.6" name="n91.6src">30</a></p>
<p>Women whose relatives have recovered from a dangerous attack of
small-pox observe a vow on every <i>s&#257;tem</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the
7th day of the dark half of every month. They first bathe with cold
water and, after offering an oblation of <i>kuler&#257;</i>, take their
meals only once during the day. This food has to be prepared on the
previous day.</p>
<p>Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257; is described as riding an ass in a nude
state with the half of a <i>supadun</i> (a winnowing fan) for an
umbrella and with a swing in one hand, and a broom in the
other.<a class="noteref" id="n91.7src" href="#n91.7" name=
"n91.7src">31</a> But more usually the M&#257;t&#257; is represented by
a mere trunkless head in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e9143" href=
"#xd26e9143" name="xd26e9143">92</a>]</span>stone, besmeared with red
lead. This is said to be the head of Babhriv&#257;han, the son of
Bh&#299;ma<a class="noteref" id="n92.asrc" href="#n92.a" name=
"n92.asrc">32</a> the second of the P&#257;ndavas by a N&#257;g mother.
At the time of the Great War, he was sent by his mother from his
residence in the <i>p&#257;t&#257;l</i> (the regions below this world)
to assist his father, and as he did not know the P&#257;ndavas, he was
asked to join the weaker side. On coming to the earth he first met with
Krishna who took a promise from him to lop his own head off. In return,
Krishna promised him that he would be immortal, invisible and
worshipped by all, and the head was set up on the flag of the
P&#257;ndavas. This head began to trouble the P&#257;ndavas after their
victory, and could only be quieted by the promise of Krishna to have
him recognised as a deity with unlimited powers. This head afterwards
came to be known as the controller of small-pox. How the head of the
male Babhriv&#257;han came to be identified with Shital&#257;
M&#257;t&#257;, it is difficult to explain.<a class="noteref" id=
"n92.1src" href="#n92.1" name="n92.1src">33</a></p>
<p>There is a tradition that a Kunbi once recovered his eyesight, lost
in an attack of small-pox, by worshipping Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257;,
and by vowing not to tie his lock of hair till his blindness was
cured.<a class="noteref" id="n92.2src" href="#n92.2" name=
"n92.2src">34</a></p>
<p>It is said that the powderlike substance which falls from the scabs
of small-pox cures cataract if applied to the eyes.<a class=

<p>Daksha Praj&#257;pati once celebrated a great sacrifice, but did not
invite his son-in-law Shiva. The latter was extremely enraged at the
insult, and eight sorts of fever were in consequence produced by his
breath at that time.<a class="noteref" id="n92.3src" href="#n92.3"
name="n92.3src">35</a> According to another story <i>z&#257;r</i> or
fever was created by Shiva in order to assist the demon
B&#257;n&#257;sur in his contest with god Krishna, and it can be cured
by the recitation of a piece called Ush&#257;haran, from the
<i>Harivansha</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n92.4src" href="#n92.4" name=

his honour.<a class="noteref" id="n92.6src" href="#n92.6" name=

Tuesday a woollen thread or a piece of five-coloured silken thread is
taken to a <i>b&#257;v&#257;</i> or a <i>jogi</i>, who mutters a few

treated with frankincense, and then tied round the arm.<a class=

<p>Periodical fevers are believed to be under the control of certain
spirits. There is a story connected with almost every sort of fever,
and it is believed that a person who listens to such a story is cured
of fever.<a class="noteref" id="n93.3src" href="#n93.3" name=
"n93.3src">44</a> The following legend is connected with
<i>ek&#257;nterio</i>&mdash;intermittent fever occurring on alternate
days. Once a Bania, on his way to a village, came across a banyan tree
where he unyoked his bullocks and went to a distance to seek for water.
Ek&#257;nterio (the spirit controlling intermittent fever) resided on
this tree, and when the Bania had gone sufficiently far he stole from
behind the tree and carried away the Bania&rsquo;s carriage together
with his family. The Bania was much surprised to miss them on his
return, but he soon found out the author of the trick, and pursued
Ek&#257;nterio. That spirit however would not listen to the
Bania&rsquo;s entreaties to return his carriage, and the matter was at
last referred for arbitration to Bochki Bai. The latter decided in
favour of the Bania, and confined Ek&#257;nterio in a bamboo tube. He
was released on the condition that he would never attack those persons
who listen to this story.<a class="noteref" id="n93.4src" href="#n93.4"
name="n93.4src">45</a></p>
<p>There is a flower garden to the west of Jodia where there is a tree
called <i>ghelun</i> (mad) tree. Vows in honour of this tree are
believed to be efficacious in curing fever.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n93.4">45</a></p>
<p>It has been already said above that such epidemic diseases as
cholera or the plague are often supposed to be the result of the
sinister practices of the Bhangis. There is a belief that the Bhangis
sometimes prepare an image out of the flour of <i>adad</i> (phaseolus
radiatus) and pierce it with needles, and it is said that for every
hole made in the image one human being falls a victim to some epidemic
disease. Such an image is sometimes placed in an earthen vessel and
buried underground in a public way so that every <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e9280" title="Source: passer by">passer-by</span> treading on the
spot where it is buried may be attacked by some disease. Or it is
thrown into the well which is most used by village people, with the
object that all persons drinking water from the well may perish by the
disease.<a class="noteref" id="n93.5src" href="#n93.5" name=
"n93.5src">46</a></p>
<p>The Bhangis are also accused of causing an epidemic by means of
boiling the ear of a buffalo and the flesh of an ox together in one
vessel, it being believed that the virulence of the disease varies in
proportion to the extent to which the boiling proceeds. This process is
supposed to cause a disease among cattle also.<a class="noteref" id=
"n93.6src" href="#n93.6" name="n93.6src">47</a></p>
<p>Another belief is that the Bhangis charm seeds of <i>adad</i> and
cloves by repeating magic incantations over them, and afterwards strew
them on a highway in order that those who step on them may be attacked
by cholera or some similar disease.<a class="noteref" id="n93.7src"
href="#n93.7" name="n93.7src">48</a> One motive suggested for such
action is that they are thereby likely to receive their garments, which
would be used for covering the bodies.<a class="noteref" id="n93.8src"
href="#n93.8" name="n93.8src">49</a> Also at the outbreak of such an
epidemic, clothes, cocoanuts, ghi, molasses, wheat flour, etc., are
offered by the people to the Bhangis, who in return give a
<i>dor&#257;</i>, a piece of thread, of black wool to be worn by the
afflicted persons.<a class="noteref" id="n93.9src" href="#n93.9" name=
"n93.9src">50</a></p>
<p>But apart from such beliefs, the appearance of an epidemic is also
attributed to other causes. There is the usual belief that it is caused
by the diminution of virtue and the increase of sin among people and
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e9310" href="#xd26e9310" name=
"xd26e9310">94</a>]</span>consequent wrath of the gods, who are only
propitiated by the people again reverting to righteous ways and by the
performance of sacrifices in their honour.<a class="noteref" id=
"n94.1src" href="#n94.1" name="n94.1src">51</a></p>
<p>There is also a belief that the sixty-four Joganis, when they are
desirous of victims, cause baneful epidemics among mankind, the
remedies in such a case being such as offering a goat or a he-buffalo
to them, or the observation of an <i>uj&#257;ni</i> in their
honour.</p>
<p>The following tale is related regarding an occurrence said to have
taken place not long ago in the village of Verad. The headman of the
village who was a Rajput by birth but who had lost his caste owing to
irregular conduct with a woman, died of fever, and as he was an
outcaste his body was buried instead of being cremated. Soon after, a
number of persons in the same village happened to die of the same fever
and the people conjectured that the late <i>patel&rsquo;s</i> corpse
must be lying in its grave with its face downwards chewing the
<i>khahan</i> (? perhaps <i>kaphan</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the cloth in which
a corpse is wrapped). Many thought that the health of the village would
not be restored until the corpse was replaced in the correct position
with its face upwards and unless the <i><span class="corr" id=
"xd26e9335" title="Source: khapan">kaphan</span></i> was taken out of
its mouth. But none ventured to do so, being dissuaded by the fear of
meeting with a worse fate.</p>
<p>But although they did not open the grave yet they arranged for
certain vows to be taken in honour of the dead man, and that put a stop
to the disease.<a class="noteref" id="n94.2src" href="#n94.2" name=
"n94.2src">52</a></p>
<p>Another story from the same place is that when small-pox once raged
furiously in that village, the people of the place celebrated a
magnificent feast of dainties prepared of wheat-flour, ghi, molasses,
rice and pulse, and afterwards the Dheds of the village lopped off the
head of a dead he-buffalo, burying it at the spot where the feast was
held.<a class="noteref" id="n94.3src" href="#n94.3" name=
"n94.3src">53</a></p>
<p>The remedies adopted for the abatement of epidemic diseases have
already been mentioned above, the most common being the winding of a
cotton-thread, the pouring out of <i>dh&#257;r&#257;v&#257;di</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, milk, in the village, and the taking of the <i>rath</i> of
the M&#257;t&#257; in a procession beyond the village boundary, the
epidemic being supposed to be expelled in the <i>rath</i>. In the last
case, after the <i>rath</i> has been taken to the neighbouring village,
a charmed peg is sometimes driven into the ground near the village
boundary to prevent the epidemic from crossing back again.<a class=
"noteref" id="n94.4src" href="#n94.4" name="n94.4src">54</a></p>
<p>Mention has already been made of the deities which protect the
cattle and to whose displeasure diseases among cattle are attributed.
It is said that such diseases are very common during the <i>vishi</i>
of Shiva. A cycle of twenty years is called a <i>vishi</i>, three such
cycles making a complete <i>samvatsar</i> of sixty years. Each of such
<i>vishis</i> is presided over and named after each of the three gods
of the Trinity, Brahm&#257;, Vishnu and Shiva. The <i>vishi</i> of
Brahm&#257; is characterized by protection and creation, that of Vishnu
by growth and that of Shiva by destruction, the last often bringing on
such calamities as plague, famine and diseases among cattle.<a class=
"noteref" id="n94.5src" href="#n94.5" name="n94.5src">55</a></p>
<p>The following are some of the remedies practised by the village
people in the case of certain cattle-diseases.</p>
<p>In the case of such diseases as <i>mov&#257; kharav&#257;</i> or the
like, there is a practice of burying a plough near one&rsquo;s gates,
which is afterwards covered with dust gathered from three streets and
is worshiped with a branch of a tree, a plate of iron and red lead.
This ceremony has to be performed either on a Sunday or a Tuesday, and
the man who performs it has to remain naked at the time.<a class=
"noteref" id="n94.6src" href="#n94.6" name="n94.6src">56</a></p>
<p>For the cure of <i>valo</i> (a disease in which the throat is
inflamed), pieces of the stalk of <i>kukad-vel</i> (a kind of creeper)
are tied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e9409" href="#xd26e9409"
name="xd26e9409">95</a>]</span>round the neck or the horns of the
diseased animal and no other food except ghi and molasses is allowed to
it for two or three days. A handful of salt is sometimes thrown on the
back of the animal.<a class="noteref" id="n95.1src" href="#n95.1" name=
"n95.1src">57</a> Sesamum oil is also said to work as a good medicine
in the case of the same disease.<a class="noteref" id="n95.2src" href=
"#n95.2" name="n95.2src">58</a></p>
<p>Another remedy for the same disease is to pass a knotted bamboo
stick with seven knots seven times over the back of the ailing
animal.<a class="noteref" id="n95.3src" href="#n95.3" name=
"n95.3src">59</a></p>
<p>Ghi is sometimes used as a medicine in the case of small-pox. In the
case of <i>shakario</i> or <i>k&#257;lo v&#257;</i>, the animal is
branded in the affected limbs. To one suffering from a stye in the eye
an ointment prepared from the horn of a deer is applied, while a
mixture of whey and salt is said to be useful in most eye maladies. The
treatment for the swelling of the belly is a mixture of molasses,
<i>ajamo</i> (ligusticum ajwaen) and <i>sanchal</i> (a kind of salt).
To cure an animal of <i>kh&#257;pari</i> (a disease which affects
milch-cattle), the milk of the affected animal is poured on
<i>r&#257;fd&#257;</i> (a kind of jujube tree). If after delivery, some
part of the embryo remains inside an animal, milk and molasses are
given to expedite its removal.<a class="noteref" id="n95.4src" href=
"#n95.4" name="n95.4src">60</a></p>
<p>In the case of <i>kharav&#257;</i> the ailing animal is made to move
about in hot sand and is treated with salt, which is first fried on the
fire of <i>Holi</i>. The remedy for the disease known as
<i>kumbhava</i> is to give a dose of castor oil, <i>sanchal</i>,
<i>ajamo</i> and hot water to the sick animal and also to tie a magic
thread round its neck.<a class="noteref" id="n95.5src" href="#n95.5"
name="n95.5src">61</a></p>
<p>A disease called <i>okarinu</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, vomitting) sometimes
breaks out among sheep. In this case the shepherds separate all the
affected animals from the herd and remove them to a distance. All the
sheep which die of the disease are buried deep in a pit, which is
guarded for several days, lest some other animals dig it up and let
lose the buried epidemic by exposing the carcasses. It is believed that
the contagion of this disease lies in the ears; and the ears of all the
sheep in the herd are carefully watched if they bleed.<a class=

<p>The twin gods <span class="corr" id="xd26e9480" title=
"Source: Ashivini">Ashvini</span> Kum&#257;r are sometimes propitiated
by means of an <i>anushth&#257;n</i> (the performance of religious
austerities in their honour) in order that they may put a stop to a
disease among cattle.<a class="noteref" id="n95.7src" href="#n95.7"
name="n95.7src">63</a></p>
<p>It appears that dancing often forms a part of the process of
exorcism. Frequently dancing is accompanied by the beating of cymbals
and drums and other loud noises. A <i>mandalu</i> is convened at the
house of the person who is to be exorcised <i>i.e.</i>, a number of
<i>bhuv&#257;s</i> are invited to attend along with a number of
low-caste drummers, and afterwards the ceremony of <i>ut&#257;r</i> is
gone through; the <i>ut&#257;r</i> is then taken to a
cemetery.<a class="noteref" id="n95.8src" href="#n95.8" name=
"n95.8src">64</a></p>
<p>Sometimes the beating of drums and cymbals is alone resorted to for
expelling an evil spirit from the person of a patient. It is believed
that this process is effectual in proportion to the degree of the
intensity of the noise created.<a class="noteref" id="n95.9src" href=
"#n95.9" name="n95.9src">65</a> The patient is asked to sit facing the
east. The B&#257;val or V&#257;ghri <i>i.e.</i>, the drummer, sits in
front of him, and not only beats the drum as loudly as he can, but also
sings hymns at the top of his voice in honour of his favourite goddess.
In the meanwhile, the <i>bhuv&#257;</i>, who is also in attendance,
begins to be possessed, and discloses the fact by convulsive fits.
After a while, the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> suddenly stamps his foot furiously
on the floor, and, seizing the patient by a lock of his hair, and
perhaps even giving him a blow on the back, asks in a stern
voice<span class="corr" id="xd26e9525" title="Not in source">,</span>
&ldquo;Who art thou? speak out at once why thou hast come or else I
will burn thee to death.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="n95.asrc" href=
"#n95.a" name="n95.asrc">66</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e9532" href="#xd26e9532" name="xd26e9532">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>The patient will then perhaps reply: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?
I am <i>ch&#257;ran</i>&rsquo;, or I am <i>z&#257;mh&#257;di</i>, (a
female spirit guarding the village gates) or
<i>V&#257;gharan</i><a class="noteref" id="n96.asrc" href="#n96.a"
name="n96.asrc">67</a> or <i>Purvaj</i> (the spirit of a deceased
ancestor). Regarding the reason for possession, the evil spirit will
give some such explanation as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Once upon a time
the patient was taking a loaf and vegetables which he hid from me, and
therefore I shall leave his person only with his life.&rdquo; The
<i>bhuv&#257;</i> will then say &ldquo;life is precious and not so
cheap as you think. If you want anything else, say so and leave this
person.&rdquo; After a dialogue such as the above, the
<i>bhuv&#257;</i> and the spirit come to some compromise, and the
<i>bhuv&#257;</i> then leads a procession with the <i>ut&#257;r</i>
either to the village boundary or to a cemetery. The <i>bhuv&#257;</i>
then draws a circle on the ground with the point of a sword which he
carries, and places the <i>ut&#257;r</i> within the circle. He then
slightly cuts the tip of his tongue with the edge of the sword, and
spits blood into a fire lighted for the purpose. The smoke of this fire
is supposed to carry the offering to the evil spirit. The
<i>ut&#257;r</i> is then taken away by the drummers, who share it
secretly with the <i>bhuv&#257;</i>. In the event of the patient
deriving no benefit from this ceremony, the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> advises
the patient&rsquo;s relatives to repeat the process.<a class="noteref"
id="n96.1src" href="#n96.1" name="n96.1src">68</a></p>
<p>The following ceremony is sometimes performed in order to ascertain
whether a person is under the influence of an evil spirit or not. A
<i>bhuv&#257;</i> is invited to the patient&rsquo;s house in the
company of drummers, and there he dances for some time amidst the din
produced by the beating of the drums and by the loud recitation of
hymns in honour of his favourite goddess. Afterwards a handful of grain
is passed round the head of the patient and presented to the
<i>bhuv&#257;</i> for inspection. The <i>bhuv&#257;</i> selects a few
seeds from the grain and making certain gestures, offers them to the
patient with either the words &lsquo;<i>v&#257;cho</i>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<i>vadh&#257;vo</i>&rsquo;. In case the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> says
&lsquo;<i>v&#257;cho</i>&rsquo; and the number of seeds happens to be
even, what he declared to be the cause of the patient&rsquo;s trouble
is believed to be true. So also if the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> says
<i>vadh&#257;vo</i> and the number of seeds proves to be odd. But in
case the number of seeds proves to be odd when the <i>bhuv&#257;</i>
says &lsquo;<i>v&#257;cho</i>&rsquo;, or even, when he says
<i>vadh&#257;vo</i>, then his explanation of the cause of the
patient&rsquo;s trouble is not credited.</p>
<p>Sometimes Br&#257;hmans instead of <i>bhuv&#257;s</i> are engaged to
exorcise an evil spirit from the body of a sick person. A <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e9626" title="Source: bellmetal">bell-metal</span> dish,
containing <i>adad</i> (phaseolus radiatus)<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e9632" title="Not in source">,</span> wheat and
<i>jow&#257;ri</i>, is placed on a copper jar and struck violently with
a stick, called <i>velan</i>, so as to produce a loud noise. The
patient, who is made to sit in front, begins to tremble and sometimes
even to rave. The Br&#257;hmans also create a loud noise and in a loud
voice ask the patient who the evil spirit is and what it wants. The
patient will then give out the name of some notorious <i>d&#257;kan</i>
(witch) or of one of his deceased ancestors and will add that he
desires a certain thing which he was used to get while in human form.
The evil spirit is then propitiated by offering the things asked for
and is requested to leave the body of the patient.<a class="noteref"
id="n96.2src" href="#n96.2" name="n96.2src">69</a></p>
<p>The following are other methods of expelling an evil spirit from the
body:&mdash;</p>
<p>Either <i>lobh&#257;n</i><span class="corr" id="xd26e9654" title=
"Not in source">,</span> <i>i.e.</i>, incense powder, or chillies or
even the excreta of dogs are burnt under the nose of the patient, who,
overpowered<a id="xd26e9660" name="xd26e9660"></a> by the unpleasant
odour, is supposed to give out the name of the evil spirit and also
what the latter wants.</p>
<p>Water is charmed with incantations, and is either dashed against the
patient&rsquo;s eyes or is given to him to drink.<a class="noteref" id=
"n96.3src" href="#n96.3" name="n96.3src">70</a></p>
<p>If the evil spirit possessing a patient is a
<i>purvaj</i><span class="corr" id="xd26e9671" title=
"Not in source">,</span> <i>i.e.</i>, the spirit of a deceased
ancestor, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e9677" href="#xd26e9677"
name="xd26e9677">97</a>]</span>either <i>N&#257;r&#257;yan-bali
Shr&#257;ddha</i> or <i>Nil-Parvani Shr&#257;ddha</i> or <i>Tripindi
Shr&#257;ddha</i> is performed in order to propitiate it, and a party
of Br&#257;hmans is invited to dinner. In case the <i>purvaj</i> is a
female, a cocoanut is installed in a <i>gokhalo</i> (a niche) in the
wall to represent it, <i>ghi</i> lamps are lighted, and frankincense is
burnt every morning before it. On the anniversary of the death of the
<i>purvaj</i> a party of <i>gor&#257;nis</i> (unwidowed women) is
invited to dinner.<a class="noteref" id="n97.1src" href="#n97.1" name=
"n97.1src">71</a></p>
<p>If a woman is believed to be possessed by a <i>d&#257;kan</i>, she
is made to hold a shoe in her teeth and is taken to the village
boundary, where the shoe is dropped, and a circle is drawn round it
with water from a bowl carried by the party. The holding of the shoe by
the teeth signifies a vow on the part of the <i>d&#257;kan</i> never to
re-enter the person of the exorcised woman.<a class="noteref" id=
"n97.2src" href="#n97.2" name="n97.2src">72</a></p>
<p>The following are other occasions for religious dancing, namely
during the <i>Nav-r&#257;tra</i> holidays (<i>i.e.</i>, the festival
which commences from the 1st day of the bright half of <i><span class=
"corr" id="xd26e9728" title=
"Source: &Aacute;shvin">&#256;shvin</span></i> and lasts for nine
days); at the time of offering oblations to the village-gods; on the
occasion of setting up a pillar in memory of a deceased person; at the
time of the <i>Nilotsava</i><a class="noteref" id="n97.asrc" href=
"#n97.a" name="n97.asrc">73</a> ceremony.</p>
<p>At the time when Randal the wife of Surya is installed and
worshipped, a party of young women dance in a circle before the goddess
to the accompaniment of <i>garabis</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n97.3src"
href="#n97.3" name="n97.3src">74</a></p>
<p>The eighth day of the bright half of <i>&#256;shvin</i> is dedicated
to the worship of the <i>M&#257;t&#257;s</i> and <i>devis</i> (minor
goddesses), and on this day, <i>bhuv&#257;s</i> have to dance each
before his favourite <i>m&#257;t&#257;</i>. This they have also to do
on the 1st day of the bright half of <i>&#256;sh&#257;dh</i>.
<i>Bhuv&#257;s</i> are also invited to dance on the
<i>Diw&#257;s&#257;</i> day <i>i.e.</i>, the last day of
<i>&#256;sh&#257;dh</i>.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n97.3">74</a></p>
<p>The <i>bhuv&#257;</i> occupies a high place in the esteem of the
village people, and commands much respect. In the first place, his
position is that of a medium between the gods and goddesses on the one
hand and human beings on the other.<a class="noteref" id="n97.4src"
href="#n97.4" name="n97.4src">75</a> He is the interpreter of the will
of the gods, which he expresses to the public when in a state of
trance. Besides he is believed to have power over the evil spirits
which are visible to a <i>bhuv&#257;</i> though cannot be seen by
ordinary eyes.<a class="noteref" id="n97.5src" href="#n97.5" name=
"n97.5src">76</a> He is the guardian of the village, his duty, being to
protect the people from the malignant influence of the evil
spirits.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n97.5">76</a></p>
<p>In the next place, it is also the office of the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> to
treat the sick. In cases when medicine is unavailing and where the
malady is supposed to be the work of some evil spirit, the opinion of
the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> is sought by the relations of the patient and is
given by the test of the scrutiny of grain.<a class="noteref" id=
"n97.6src" href="#n97.6" name="n97.6src">77</a> When the sick person is
found to be under the influence of a spirit, the common mode of
exorcising is to take an <i>ut&#257;r</i> to the cemetery. An image of
a human being is prepared out of the flour of <i>adad</i> (phaseolus
<span class="corr" id="xd26e9821" title=
"Source: radialus">radiatus</span>) and is passed round the body of the
sick person. The <i>bhuv&#257;</i> then holds the image near his heart
and stretches himself on a bier with the image on his bosom. In this
condition the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> is taken to the cemetery, and the evil
spirit is believed to be driven by these means out of the
patient&rsquo;s body.<a class="noteref" id="n97.7src" href="#n97.7"
name="n97.7src">78</a></p>
<p>The <i>bhuv&#257;</i> distributes <i>dor&#257;s</i> (magic threads)
and anklets among the people. Such things are coveted for their
efficacy in warding off the influence of evil spirits and are often
sought after by people for their cattle as well as for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e9841" href="#xd26e9841" name=
"xd26e9841">98</a>]</span>themselves.<a class="noteref" id="n98.1src"
href="#n98.1" name="n98.1src">79</a> The prosperity of the
<i>d&#257;nkl&#257;n-vag&#257;dn&#257;rs</i> (those who beat the drum)
depends to a large extent on the success of the
<i>bhuv&#257;&rsquo;s</i> business, and for this reason, the drummers
are often very good advocates of the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> and take every
opportunity of glorifying his powers and merits.</p>
<p>The respect which a <i>bhuv&#257;</i> commands in this way is
sometimes increased by the performance of such tricks as his putting
lighted torches into his mouth, placing his hand in boiling oil, and
similar performances.</p>
<p>But although there may be some <i>bhuv&#257;s</i> who profit by
imposing upon the credulity of the villagers, there are many
<i>bhuv&#257;s</i> who do not work with the expectation of any reward,
and are only actuated by benevolent motives. Many of them honestly
believe that at the time when they are thrown into a state of trance,
the <i>m&#257;t&#257;s</i> or deities actually enter their bodies and
speak their wishes through them as a medium.</p>
<p>In some villages, the office of the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> is hereditary,
and lands have been assigned to them in remuneration for their
duty<a class="noteref" id="n98.2src" href="#n98.2" name=
"n98.2src">80</a>. In addition to this religious calling, a
<i>bhuv&#257;</i> often follows some other profession as that of
agriculture, weaving or spinning.<a class="noteref" id="n98.3src" href=
"#n98.3" name="n98.3src">81</a></p>
<p>The <i>bhuv&#257;</i> generally belongs to some low caste and may be
a Koli, Bharv&#257;d<span class="corr" id="xd26e9894" title=
"Not in source">,</span> Rab&#257;ri, V&#257;ghri or even a
Cham&#257;r. The <i>bhuv&#257;s</i> are also known as
<i>pothi&#257;s</i>. One good qualification for becoming a
<i>bhuv&#257;</i> is to possess the habit of throwing one&rsquo;s self
into convulsive fits followed by a state of trance, especially on
hearing the beating of a <i>d&#257;nkl&#257;n</i> (drum). At such a
time the <i>m&#257;t&#257;</i> or <i>devi</i> is supposed to possess
the person of the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> and to speak out her wishes on
being questioned. Some <i>bhuv&#257;s</i> are regularly possessed by
some <i>devi</i> or <i>m&#257;t&#257;</i> on every Sunday or
Tuesday.<a class="noteref" id="n98.4src" href="#n98.4" name=
"n98.4src">82</a></p>
<p>A typical <i>bhuv&#257;</i> has a braid of hair on his head, puts
one or more iron or copper anklets round his leg or elbow, and makes a
mark with red lead on his forehead. A <i>bhuv&#257;</i> attending upon
the goddess Meldi is generally<a class="noteref" id="n98.5src" href=
"#n98.5" name="n98.5src">83</a> a V&#257;ghri by caste and always wears
dirty clothes. A Bharv&#257;d <i>bhuv&#257;</i> has generally a silver
anklet round his waist. A <i>bhuv&#257;</i> has to observe a fast on
all the nine days of the <i>Nav-r&#257;tras</i>. If a <i>bhuv&#257;</i>
happens to come across another <i>bhuv&#257;</i> in convulsive fits or
in a trance, he must need go into fits as well.</p>
<p>Generally speaking every <i>bhuv&#257;</i> keeps an image of his
favourite <i>m&#257;t&#257;</i> in or near his own dwelling. Generally
he erects a hut for the purpose and hoists a flag upon it. Near the
image are placed a number of conch-shells and stones and brooms of
peacock feathers. The deity is not systematically worshipped every day
but receives adoration every Sunday and Tuesday. Sometimes the
<i>bhuv&#257;</i> has a disciple&mdash;a <i>sevaka</i>&mdash;who does
the duty of dashing bell-metal cymbals at the time when the
<i>bhuv&#257;</i> throws himself in a trance.<a class="noteref" id=
"n98.6src" href="#n98.6" name="n98.6src">84</a></p>
<p>When a new <i>bhuv&#257;</i> is to be initiated into the profession,
he is made to sit before an image of the <i>m&#257;t&#257;</i>, where
he goes into convulsive fits while the <i>d&#257;nkl&#257;n
vag&#257;dn&#257;rs</i> beat the drums and loudly recite hymns in
honour of the deity. Afterwards he is taken to a cemetery accompanied
by the drummers and an expert <i>bhuv&#257;</i>, where the latter marks
out a square on the ground with the edge of a sword. The novice is
asked to lie prostrate within the area thus marked out and to get up
and lie again, doing the same four times, each time with his head
towards each of the four quarters. The <i>bhuv&#257;</i> who initiates
the novice and who is thenceforth considered to be the <i>guru</i> or
preceptor of the latter, ties a <i>r&#257;khadi</i> (a piece of silk
thread) round the elbow of the pupil.<a class="noteref" id="n98.7src"
href="#n98.7" name="n98.7src">85</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e10007" href="#xd26e10007" name="xd26e10007">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>Every <i>bhuv&#257;</i> is required to propitiate his favourite
goddess every third year, the ceremony which is then performed being
called <i>Khad-Khadya-bes&#257;dvi</i>. This is performed either during
the <i>Nav-r&#257;tra</i> holidays or during the bright half of either
the month of <i>M&#257;gh</i> or <i>Chaitra</i>. All the
<i>bhuv&#257;s</i> in the village are invited on the occasion, when
there is <i>g&#257;nj&#257;</i>-smoking or <i>bh&#257;ng</i>-drinking,
partly at night. After the supper which follows this party, all the
<i>bhuv&#257;s</i> gather together and go into convulsive fits till
they are almost suffocated. Cocoanuts are then dedicated and cracked
before the <i>m&#257;t&#257;</i>, and the kernel is distributed among
those present. The party then break up.<a class="noteref" id="n99.1src"
href="#n99.1" name="n99.1src">86</a></p>
<p>It is believed by some people that the spirit of a Muhammadan saint,
living or dead, dwells in such trees as the <i>Khijado</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Shami</i> (Prosopis spicigera) and <i>B&#257;val</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>B&#257;bhul</i> (Acacia arabica). It is known by the
name of <i>chitharia</i> that is, the ragged <i>Pir</i>. It is a common
belief that if a mother fails to offer a rag or a piece of cloth to
such a holy tree while passing by it, her children run the risk of
falling ill. Women and ignorant people, therefore, make a point of
offering rags to such trees whenever they happen to pass by
them.<a class="noteref" id="n99.2src" href="#n99.2" name=
"n99.2src">87</a></p>
<p>According to another belief, travellers, in order to accomplish
their journey safely, offer rags to such of the <i>Khijado</i>,
<i>B&#257;val</i> or <i>Limdo</i> (Nim) trees as are reputed to be the
residences of spirits, if they happen to be on their road.<a class=
"noteref" id="n99.3src" href="#n99.3" name="n99.3src">88</a></p>
<p>Some believe that both male and female spirits reside in the
<i>Khijado</i>, <i>B&#257;val</i> and <i>Kerado</i> trees, and throw
rags over them with the object of preventing passers by from cutting or
removing the trees. Some pile stones round their stems and draw
tridents over them with red lead and oil. If superstitious people come
across such trees, they throw pieces of stones on the piles, believing
them to be holy places, and think that by doing so they attain the
merit of building a temple or shrine. A belief runs that this pile
should grow larger and larger day by day, and not be diminished. If the
base of such a tree is not marked by a pile of stones, rags only are
offered; and if rags are not available, the devotee tears off a piece
of his garment, however costly it may be, and dedicates it to the
tree.<a class="noteref" id="n99.4src" href="#n99.4" name=
"n99.4src">89</a></p>
<p>Once, a child saw its mother offering a rag to such a tree, and
asked her the reason of the offering. The mother replied that her
brother, that is the child&rsquo;s maternal uncle, dwelt in the tree.
Hence a belief arose that a <i>chithario</i> (ragged) uncle dwells in
such trees. Others assert that the <i>chithario pir</i> dwells in such
trees, and they propitiate him by offering cocoanuts and burning
frankincense before it.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n99.4">89</a></p>
<p>There is a <i>Khijado</i> tree near Sult&#257;npur which is believed
to be the residence of a demon <i>m&#257;mo</i>. This demon is
propitiated by the offerings of rags.</p>
<p>Some declare that travellers fix rags of worn out clothes to the
trees mentioned above in order that they may not be attacked by the
evil spirits residing in them. Another belief is that the spirits of
deceased ancestors residing in such trees get absolution through this
form of devotion. It is also believed that a goddess called
<i>chitharia devi</i> resides in such trees, and being pleased with
these offerings, blesses childless females with children, and cures
persons suffering from itch of their disease. There is a further belief
that ragged travellers, by offering pieces of their clothes to the
<i>Khijado</i>, <i>B&#257;val</i> or <i>Kerado</i> trees, are blessed
in return with good clothes.</p>
<p>Some believe that Hanum&#257;n, the lord of spirits, resides in
certain trees. They call him <i>chithario</i> or ragged Hanum&#257;n.
All passers by offer rags to the trees inhabited by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e10141" href="#xd26e10141" name=
"xd26e10141">100</a>]</span>him. There is such a tree near the station
of Shiroi. There is a tamarind tree on the road from Tamnagar to
Khantalia which is believed to be the residence of <i>chithario</i>
Hanum&#257;n and receives similar offerings. Another tamarind tree of
this description is near Marad and there is a <i>Khijado</i> tree on
the road between K&#257;l&#257;vad and V&#257;vadi which is similarly
treated.<a class="noteref" id="n100.1src" href="#n100.1" name=
"n100.1src">90</a></p>
<p>It is related by some people that in deserts trees are rare and the
summer heat is oppressive. To the travellers passing through such
deserts, the only place of rest is in the shadow of a solitary tree
that is to be met occasionally. In order that no harm be done to such
trees, some people have given currency to the belief that a spirit
called <i>m&#257;mo</i> dwells in such trees and expects the offering
of a rag and a pice at the hands of every passer by.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n100.1">90</a></p>
<p>Some are of opinion that the <i>bhuv&#257;s</i>, in order to raise
money from the credulous by terrifying them, daub a tree within the
limits of each village with the form of a trident, and fix rags to it,
stating that it is the abode of a <i>m&#257;mo</i> or a <i>pir</i>. At
times they ask their clients to offer certain things to such trees,
which they appropriate to themselves.<a class="noteref" id="n100.2src"
href="#n100.2" name="n100.2src">91</a></p>
<p>There is also a belief, that the holy trees that receive offerings
of rags from travellers, are the abodes of gods or evil spirits, and
are distinguished from other trees of the same species by the epithet
of <i>chithario</i>. Some people hoist flags on such trees instead of
offering rags.</p>
<p>In some places, the <i>Bor&#257;di</i> (jujube), <i>Pipal</i>,
<i>Vad</i> (banyan) and the sweet basil receive offerings of a pice and
a betelnut from travellers, while the <i>Khijado</i> and
<i>B&#257;val</i> are given rags.<a class="noteref" id="n100.3src"
href="#n100.3" name="n100.3src">92</a></p>
<p>It is stated by some people that the belief in <i>chithario</i> pir
has grown during the last four hundred years.</p>
<p>Rags are never offered to wells, but it is common to offer them
copper coins and betelnuts. Sometimes flags are hoisted near holy wells
in honour of the water-goddess Jaldevki. Travellers hoist flags on
certain wells and throw copper coins into them in the course of their
journey. The origin of this offering is said to be in the desire of
travellers to prevent people from committing a nuisance near wells.</p>
<p>Some wells are noted as being the abode of spirits who have the
power of effecting certain cures. It is customary to throw a pice in
such wells. When a person is bitten by a rabid dog, he goes to a well
inhabited by a <i>v&#257;chharo</i>, the spirit who cures hydrophobia,
with two earthen cups filled with milk, with a pice in each, and
empties the contents into the water.</p>
<p>It is a belief among Hindus that to give alms in secret confers a
great merit on the donor. Some of the orthodox people, therefore, throw
pice into wells, considering it to be a kind of secret charity.</p>
<p>The belief in the practices adopted for transferring disease from
one person to another obtains mostly among women, who have recourse to
such practices for curing their children.</p>
<p>One of such practices is to lay a suffering child in the cradle of a
healthy child. This act is believed to result in transferring the
disease of the ailing child to the healthy child. Another practice is
that the mother of the sickly child should touch the mother of a
healthy child with the object of transferring the disease of her child
to the child of the latter. Some believe that the mere contact of an
ailing child with a healthy child is sufficient to transfer the malady
of the former to the person of the latter. Others maintain that this
can be brought about by a mother either by touching the cradle of
another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e10219" href="#xd26e10219"
name="xd26e10219">101</a>]</span>child or by touching the person of
another woman. There are others, who hold that the disease of a sickly
child can be transferred to another child by feeding the latter with
the leavings of the former. There is a further belief that a mother can
transfer the disease of her suffering child to the child of another
woman by applying the end of her robe to the end of the robe of the
latter. In some places, when a child begins to weaken, its mother makes
an idol of cow or buffalo dung, and keeps it fixed to a wall of the
house, in the belief that the child will be cured slowly as the idol
dries. It is stated that instances are actually known of the recovery
of children by this process. These methods of transferring disease are
called <i>tuchak&#257;s</i> <i>i.e.</i> mystic methods. As a rule
superstitious women practise them on Sundays or Tuesdays, as it is
believed, that to be efficacious, they must be practised on these
days.</p>
<p>In addition to the <i>tuchak&#257;s</i> above stated the
<i>ut&#257;rs</i>, <i>dor&#257;s</i>, etc., already described, are used
for curing diseases.</p>
<p>Some diseases are attributed to <i>vir</i> possession. <i>Virs</i>
are male spirits fifty two in number. The <i>bhuv&#257;s</i> or
exorcists are believed to have control over them, and are supposed to
be able to detect an illness caused by possession by a vir. In such
cases, the <i>bhuv&#257;s</i> drive away the evil spirits from the
patients by magic incantations, or transfer them to others by waving a
certain number of grain seeds round the head of the patient. By another
process the <i>bhuv&#257;s</i> can confine the evil spirit in a glass
bottle, which is buried underground.</p>
<p>In order to eradicate a dangerous disease, an <i>ut&#257;r</i> is
frequently offered to a dog, in the belief that by eating the
<i>ut&#257;r</i> the disease is transferred to the dog.</p>
<p>In some places, diseases of long standing due to spirit possession
are cured by employing a <i>bhuv&#257;</i>, (exorcist), who,
accompanied by others of his order, goes to the patient&rsquo;s house,
makes a bamboo bier, waves an <i>ut&#257;r</i> round the
patient&rsquo;s head, and lays himself on the bier with the
<i>ut&#257;r</i> by his side. The bier is carried to the burning ground
by four persons to the accompaniment of the beatings of drums, followed
by the exorcists, who throw <i>b&#257;kl&#257;ns</i> (round flat cakes
of <i>juv&#257;ri</i> flour) into the air as the procession moves on.
When the party reach the burning ground, the bier is put down, and the
<i>bhuv&#257;</i>, shaking violently, offers the <i>ut&#257;r</i> to a
spirit of the place. He then prostrates himself four times with his
face turned towards the four directions and drives a nail into the
ground at each turn. Next, the <i>bhuv&#257;</i> lets loose a goat or a
ram, to which the vir in the body of the patient is supposed to be
transferred. It is said that the performance of this rite relieves the
patient&rsquo;s mind of anxiety regarding the cause of his disease, and
he thereafter shows signs of improvement.<a class="noteref" id=
"n101.1src" href="#n101.1" name="n101.1src">93</a></p>
<p>When a man is suffering from <i>&#257;njani</i> (a sore or mole on
the eye-lid) he goes to another person&rsquo;s house and strikes
earthen vessels against his door saying &ldquo;I have shaken the
vessels. May the <i>&#257;njani</i> be with me to-day and with you
tomorrow&rdquo;. It is also stated that such a patient goes to the
house of a man who has two wives while the latter <span class="corr"
id="xd26e10302" title="Source: is">are</span> asleep, and taps his door
uttering the words &ldquo;<i>Anjani ghar bh&#257;ngani &#257;j mane ane
kal tane</i>&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;May <i>&#257;njani</i>, the
breaker of the house, be to-day with me and tomorrow with thee.&rdquo;
This process is believed to transfer the disease from the person of the
patient to that of the husband of the two wives.</p>
<p>A common method for transferring disease is to wave water round a
sick person and give it to another to drink. Similarly, a goblet filled
with water is passed round a patient&rsquo;s head and offered to a
<i>bhuv&#257;</i>, who drinks off the contents.</p>
<p>A belief prevails all over Gujar&#257;t that a disease can be passed
from one species of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e10322" href=
"#xd26e10322" name="xd26e10322">102</a>]</span>animals to another, and
various practices are adopted to effect this. Generally a
<i>bhuv&#257;</i> or exorcist arranges the transfer. The
<i>bhuv&#257;</i>, accompanied by a troupe of dancers and drummers,
visits the house of the sick person and, after examining corn seeds
<i>d&#257;n&#257;s</i> which have been waved round the patient&rsquo;s
head on a night preceding a Sunday or Tuesday, declares that the evil
spirit possessing the patient requires a living victim. A cock, goat or
a male buffalo is then brought as a substitute for the patient, is
waved round him, the tip of its right ear is cut off, and it is offered
to the <i>m&#257;t&#257;</i> or goddess, that is, it is released to
stray as it pleases. These goats, etc., are called
<i>m&#257;t&#257;&rsquo;s</i> goats, <i>m&#257;t&#257;&rsquo;s</i>
cocks, or <i>m&#257;t&#257;&rsquo;s</i> male buffaloes, and are seen
wandering about in many villages. Sometimes the goat, etc., is killed
before the image of the <i>m&#257;t&#257;</i> and the <i>bhuv&#257;</i>
dipping the palms of his hands into its blood, presses them against the
doors of every house in the village. In the case of an outbreak of
epidemic, the victim is set at liberty beyond the limits of the village
affected. It is believed by some people that the animal to which a
disease is conveyed in the above manner, dies of its effects.<a class=
"noteref" id="n102.1src" href="#n102.1" name="n102.1src">94</a></p>
<p>In some places the patient is supposed to be possessed by a goddess
instead of by an evil spirit. A goat, cock or a male buffalo is offered
to the goddess in the same way as to an evil spirit.</p>
<p>In some villages, when there is an outbreak of a serious epidemic,
it is customary to drive a buffalo beyond the village boundary, with
the disease on his back. The back of the buffalo which is chosen for
this purpose is marked with a trident in red lead and covered with a
piece of black cloth, on which are laid a few grains of <i>adad</i> and
an iron nail. Thus decorated, the buffalo is driven beyond the limits
of the village. It is believed that an animal driven in this way
carries the disease wherever it goes.</p>
<p>Very often, the beast to which a disease is transferred is kept tied
to a post all its life, with the belief that by so doing the disease
remains enchained. Jain teachers confine a disease in a bottle and bury
it underground. Sometimes, a disease is passed on to a crow, whose legs
are tied to a pillar, thus making it a life-long prisoner.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, when there was an outbreak of cholera in a certain
village, a <i>b&#257;v&#257;</i> (recluse) happened to arrive on the
scene. He caught two rams, made them move in a circle, and left them in
the burning ground, where they died, the epidemic disappearing with
their death. Hence a belief gained ground that an epidemic of cholera
can be expelled by passing it on to two rams or goats.<a class=
"noteref" id="n102.2src" href="#n102.2" name="n102.2src">95</a></p>
<p>It is related that, at Gondal, a case of cholera was cured by a
Bhangi (sweeper) by waving a cock round the patient&rsquo;s
head.<a class="noteref" id="n102.3src" href="#n102.3" name=
"n102.3src">96</a></p>
<p>A few years ago there lived in Kh&#257;khi Jalia, a village in the
vicinity of Kolki, a <i>Kh&#257;khi</i> (recluse) named
N&#257;rand&#257;s, who, when laid up with fever, passed on the disease
to his blanket, and after a time drew it back to his own person.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The spirits of a deceased father, grand father, great
grand father, and of a mother, grand mother, and great grand mother,
<i>i.e.</i>, all the male and female ascendants up to the third degree,
receive systematic worship when the <i>Shr&#257;ddha</i> or funeral
ceremonies are performed either on the anniversary of the death of any
of them or on the day when the <i>N&#257;r&#257;yan bali</i> is
performed in such holy places as Gay&#257;, <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e10399" title="Source: Sidadhapur">Siddhapur</span> or
Prabh&#257;s P&#257;tan. The spirits of those who meet heroic deaths on
fields of battle are called <i>Suropuros</i>, and pillars are erected
in their memory on the spot where they breathed their last. They
receive only occasional worship.<a class="noteref" id="n103.1src" href=
"#n103.1" name="n103.1src">1</a></p>
<p>The <i>purvajas</i> or spirits of deceased ancestors receive worship
on the thirteenth or fourteenth day of the dark half of
<i>Shr&#257;van</i> (the tenth month of the Gujar&#257;t Hindu year),
on the fourteenth of the dark half of <i>Ashvin</i>, on the death
anniversaries and on days on which the <i>Shr&#257;ddhas</i>,
<i>tripindis</i> or <i>nil parn&#257;vavi</i> ceremonies are performed.
On these occasions, the <i>pitriyas</i> (deceased ancestors) are
represented by twisted braids of the <i>durv&#257;</i> grass
(<span lang="la">cynodon dactylon</span>)<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e10439" title="Not in source">.</span><a class="noteref" id=
"n103.2src" href="#n103.2" name="n103.2src">2</a></p>
<p><i>Purvajas</i> or ancestral spirits descend to the level of ghosts
when they are strongly attached to worldly objects. Such spirits often
possess the bodies of their descendants, though the necessary
<i>Shr&#257;ddhas</i> are performed for their release. The 13th, 14th
and 15th days of the bright half of the months of <i>K&#257;rtik</i>
and <i>Chaitra</i> are the special days for propitiation of departed
spirits by their relatives either at home or in holy places, while the
whole of the dark half of the month of <i><span class="corr" id=
"xd26e10458" title=
"Source: Bh&#257;darw&#257;">Bh&#257;darv&#257;</span></i> is devoted
to this purpose.<a class="noteref" id="n103.asrc" href="#n103.a" name=
"n103.asrc">3</a> During this fortnight, <i>shr&#257;ddha</i> is
performed in honour of the deceased on the day corresponding to the day
of his death, when Br&#257;hmans are feasted. Thus, a person dying on
the 5th day of <i>K&#257;rtik</i> has his <i>shr&#257;ddha</i>
performed on the 5th day of the <i>shar&#257;dian</i>. On this
occasion, water is poured at the root of the <i>Pipal</i>,
<i>tarpan</i> or offerings of water are made, and <i>pinds</i> or balls
of rice are offered to the deceased.</p>
<p>Of all the days of the <i>shar&#257;dian</i> the 13th, 14th and 15th
are considered to be of special importance.</p>
<p>The death <span class="corr" id="xd26e10497" title=
"Source: annivesary">anniversary</span> of a <i>pitriya</i> is called
<i>samvatsari</i>, <i>valgo samachari</i> or <i>chhamachhari</i>, when
a <i>shr&#257;ddha</i> is performed and Br&#257;hmans are feasted.</p>
<p>The <i>pitriyas</i> are also worshipped on auspicious occasions such
as marriages, by the performance of a <i>shr&#257;ddha</i> called
<i>n&#257;ndi</i>, when <i>pinds</i> (balls) of molasses are offered
instead of rice. It is considered an act of merit to perform
<i>shr&#257;ddha</i> in honour of the <i>pitriyas</i> on the banks of a
river or tank at midday on the 8th day of the dark half of a month.</p>
<p>From the 13th to the 15th day of the dark half of
<i>Shr&#257;van</i>, after their morning ablutions, orthodox people
pour water over the <i>Pipal</i>, the <i>B&#257;bul</i>, the <i>Ber</i>
(Zizyphus jujube) and<a id="xd26e10551" name="xd26e10551"></a>
<i>durv&#257;</i> grass, and on those places where cows are known to
congregate, in the belief that by so doing the thirst of the spirits of
the deceased is quenched. It is also believed that if feasts are given
to the relatives of the deceased and to Br&#257;hmans the
<i>pitriyas</i> are satisfied.</p>
<p>According to some, the <i>Shar&#257;dian</i> lasts from the
full-moon day of the month of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e10565"
href="#xd26e10565" name=
"xd26e10565">104</a>]</span><i>Bh&#257;darv&#257;</i> to the new-moon
day of the same month, that is for a period of sixteen days. The
<i>Shr&#257;ddhas</i> of those who die on the <i>Punema</i> or
full-moon day of a month are performed on the full-moon day of
<i>Bh&#257;darv&#257;</i>, and the <i>Shr&#257;ddhas</i> of those who
die on the new-moon day <i>amavasia</i> of a month are performed on the
<i>amavasia</i> of <i>Bh&#257;darv&#257;</i>. The 13th day of the dark
half of <i>Bh&#257;darv&#257;</i> is called <i>b&#257;l&#257;
terash</i> that is <span class="corr" id="xd26e10598" title=
"Source: childrens&rsquo;">children&rsquo;s</span> thirteenth. This day
is specially devoted to the propitiation of the spirits of
children.<a class="noteref" id="n104.1src" href="#n104.1" name=
"n104.1src">4</a></p>
<p>On the <i>Shr&#257;ddha</i> days Br&#257;hmans and relatives of the
deceased are feasted, and oblations called <i>V&#257;sh</i>, consisting
of rice and sweets, are offered to crows.</p>
<p>On <i>&#256;sho Vad</i> fourteenth, that is, the fourteenth of the
dark half of <i>&#256;sho</i>, it is customary to apply red lead to the
pillars erected in honour of men that die heroic or noble deaths on
fields of battle, to break cocoanuts before them, to light lamps fed
with ghi and to offer cooked food to their spirits.<a class="noteref"
id="n104.2src" href="#n104.2" name="n104.2src">5</a></p>
<p>The spirits of those who die with strong attachment to the objects
of this world are said to enter the state known as <i>asur gati</i> or
the path of demons. In this condition the spirit of the deceased
possesses the person of one of his relatives and torments the family in
which he lived. The members of the family, when worried by his
persecutions, engage the services of a <i>bhuv&#257;</i> or exorcist,
who sets up a wooden image of the tormenting spirit in a niche in a
wall of the house. A lamp fed with <i>ghi</i> is lighted daily before
this image, and in times of trouble, a cocoanut is offered to it in the
belief that the spirit can protect the offerers from injuries.</p>
<p>The <i>pitriyas</i> or ancestral spirits are propitiated by pouring
water over the <i>Bordi</i> (jujube), the <i>Tulsi</i> (sweet
basil)<span class="corr" id="xd26e10646" title="Not in source">,</span>
the <i>Vad</i> (banyan)<span class="corr" id="xd26e10653" title=

(<span lang="la">cynodon <span class="corr" id="xd26e10664" title=

days of the bright half of <i>Chaitra</i> and on the same days of the
dark half of <i>K&#257;rtik</i> and <i>Shr&#257;van</i>. On
<i>Vaish&#257;kh Shud Trij</i>, that is, on the third of the bright
half of <i>Vaish&#257;kh</i>, which is called <i>Akh&#257; Trij</i>,
women offer to Br&#257;hmans two earthen jars filled with water and
covered with an earthen cup containing a betelnut, a pice and a
<i>p&#257;n</i> or betel leaf, for the propitiation of the spirits of
their deceased ancestors.<a class="noteref" id="n104.3src" href=
"#n104.3" name="n104.3src">6</a></p>
<p>For the propitiation of a male spirit a party of Br&#257;hmans is
feasted, and for the propitiation of a female spirit three unwidowed
married women.<a class="noteref" id="n104.4src" href="#n104.4" name=
"n104.4src">7</a></p>
<p>Rajputs, Bharv&#257;ds, Ahirs and Kolis set up either a pile of
stones or a single stone on the boundary of their village in honour of
those among them who die on battle fields. These piles or stones are
called <i>P&#257;lios</i>. On the <i>P&#257;lios</i> are placed
engraved images to represent the deceased in whose memory the
<i>P&#257;lios</i> are erected. Small pillars are also raised in the
localities where such persons met their death. On the <i>K&#257;li
Chaudas</i> or black fourteenth, that is the fourteenth day of the dark
half of <i>&#256;sho</i>, the <i>P&#257;lios</i> are daubed with red
lead and worshipped with offerings of cocoanuts. Women who have become
<i>sati</i> receive worship and offerings on the Hindu new year&rsquo;s
day.<a class="noteref" id="n104.5src" href="#n104.5" name=

<p>Spiritual guides such as Shankar&#257;ch&#257;rya,
Vallab&#257;ch&#257;rya, the <i>mah&#257;r&#257;jas</i> or spiritual
heads of the sect called Sw&#257;min&#257;r&#257;yan, L&#257;lo Bhagat
and Talo Bhagat are worshipped by their devotees with offerings of
food, garments and cash. In this <i>Kali Yuga</i> or iron age, men who
are really great are rare, and even if there be some, they are
invisible to the faulty vision of the present day degraded mortals. A
few come into contact with such holy men by virtue of the good deeds
performed by them in their past lives. These are said to attain
paradise by this <i>satsang</i><a class="noteref" id="n104.6src" href=
"#n104.6" name="n104.6src">9</a> (contact with the righteous).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e10737" href="#xd26e10737" name=
"xd26e10737">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>Holy men receive personal worship during their life-time. After they
are dead, their relics, such as impressions of their footsteps, their
photos or busts are worshipped with offerings of sandal paste, flowers,
red powder, frankincense, lamps fed with ghi and <i>&#257;rati</i>
(swingings of lamps)<span class="corr" id="xd26e10743" title=
"Not in source">.</span><a class="noteref" id="n105.1src" href=
"#n105.1" name="n105.1src">10</a></p>
<p>Every sect of Hindus has a <i>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</i> or spiritual
head, and it is considered meritorious to entertain and worship him on
certain special occasions. The <i>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</i> or <i>Guru</i>
is received with great <i>&eacute;clat</i>. His followers form a
procession and carry him in a palanquin or a carriage and pair
accompanied with music. At the house of the person who invites him, the
floor is covered with rich cloth, over which the
<i>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</i> is led to a raised seat specially arranged
for the purpose. He is then worshipped by the host with the same
details as the image of a god. His feet are washed by
<i>panch&#257;mrita</i> (five nectars), that is a mixture of ghi, milk,
honey, sugar and water, which is sipped by the worshipper and
distributed among the followers of the <i>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</i>. Very
often the feet of the <i>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</i> are washed in water,
which is considered as purifying as the <i>panch&#257;mrita</i>. Great
festivity and rejoicings are observed on this day at the house of the
<i>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s</i> host, where crowds of the
<i>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s</i> followers assemble eager for a sight
of him. After spending about half an hour in the house, the
<i>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</i> departs, first receiving valuable presents
from the host.</p>
<p>Spiritual guides who claim the power of working miracles are held in
high esteem by the people. Some of these guides are said to have
control over spiritual beings or to possess their favour. These spirits
are supposed to endow them with the power of preparing mystic threads,
which, when worn round the waist, neck or arm, cure various
diseases.</p>
<p>In the Kadav&#257;san woods, near the village of Daldi, there lives
a <i>b&#257;v&#257;</i> called Bhimputi, who is believed to possess
miraculous powers. He surprises visitors by his wonderful feats and
commands vows from the afflicted by mitigating their sufferings. Every
day, before breakfast, the <i>b&#257;v&#257;</i> visits seven villages
to collect sugar and flour, which he throws in handfuls over every
anthill which he meets on his way. This act of charity has established
him as a saint, and most of his prophecies are believed to be
fulfilled.</p>
<p>A Musalm&#257;n named Muhammad Chhail is held in great respect by
the people on account of his great magical powers. He is believed to be
in the good graces of a <i>Pir</i>, who has endowed him with the power
of commanding material objects to come to him from long distances, and
of breaking them and making them whole again.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Great men of antiquity often command worship as gods. A fast is
observed by Hindus on the 9th day of the bright half of <i>Chaitra</i>,
the birth day of R&#257;ma, whose birth anniversary is celebrated at
noon on that day in his temple. On this occasion, all visitors to the
temple offer a pice or two to his image and receive his
<i>Pras&#257;d</i>, that is, consecrated food, which consists of a
mixture of curdled milk and sugar. The birth of Krishna is celebrated
at mid-night on the eighth day of the dark half of <i>Shr&#257;van</i>,
when people keep awake for the whole of the night.</p>
<p>The Jains observe a fast for seven days from <i>Shr&#257;van Vad
B&#257;ras</i>, that is the 12th day of the dark half of
<i>Shr&#257;van</i>, to the 5th day of the bright half of
<i>Bh&#257;darv&#257;</i>, in honour of Mah&#257;vir Sw&#257;mi, one of
their spiritual teachers, who is believed to have been born on the 2nd
day of the bright half of <i>Bh&#257;darv&#257;</i>. This period is
known as the <i>Pajusan</i>, during which the Jains cause the

<p>A century ago there lived at Nalkanth&#257; a sage named
Bh&#257;ns&#257;b. He met a holy death by deep meditations, and a few
days after rose up from his grave in his original form. This led him to
be classed in the category of great men and to command divine
worship.<a class="noteref" id="n106.2src" href="#n106.2" name=

<p>If the souls of the departed ones are condemned to become ghosts,
<i>shr&#257;ddha</i> ceremonies performed by their descendants are said
to be efficacious in freeing them from their ghostly existence and
relegating them to some other form of life.</p>
<p>The lives of <i>bhuts</i> and <i>pish&#257;chas</i>, male and female
ghosts, are said to extend over a thousand years.<a class="noteref" id=

<i>Shr&#257;ddhas</i>, such as the <i>sam&#257;chari</i> <i>i.e.</i>,
the death anniversary and <i>N&#257;r&#257;yanbali</i> <i>i.e.</i>, a
<i>shr&#257;ddha</i> performed in a holy place, emancipate the ghostly
spirits from their wretched existence and make them eligible for birth
in a better form.<a class="noteref" id="n106.5src" href="#n106.5" name=
"n106.5src">16</a> Some believe that at the end of their ghostly

<p>The soul is not said to have finally perished unless it merges into
the divine self and attains <i>moksha</i> or salvation. The passions
and desires of a dying man do not permit his soul ascending beyond a
certain stage, where he or she remains as a ghost until the soul is
purged of all his or her desires and sins by the performance of funeral
ceremonies. For relieving ancestral spirits from the low order of
<i>bhuts</i> and <i>pish&#257;chas</i>, <i>shr&#257;ddhas</i> are
performed by their surviving relatives in such holy places as
Prabh&#257;s, Gay&#257; and Pindt&#257;rak. These ceremonies are known
as <i>N&#257;r&#257;yanbali</i>, <i>Nilotsarga</i> and
<i>sapt&#257;ha-p&#257;r&#257;yan</i> (recitation of a sacred book for
seven consecutive days).<a class="noteref" id="n106.7src" href=
"#n106.7" name="n106.7src">18</a></p>
<p>Those persons who die with wicked thoughts still present and their
desires not fulfilled, enter the order of evil spirits, from which they
are liberated after their desires have been satisfied and their wicked
thoughts eliminated.<a class="noteref" id="n106.8src" href="#n106.8"
name="n106.8src">19</a></p>
<p><i>Bhuts</i> and <i>pish&#257;chas</i><span class="corr" id=
"xd26e10939" title="Source: -">&mdash;</span>ghosts, male and
female&mdash;can be prevented from doing harm by recourse to certain
processes. For instance, the wife of a N&#257;gar of Gadhad&#257;
became a witch after her death and began to torment the second wife of
her husband by throwing her out of bed whenever she was asleep. To
prevent this, the husband took a vow to perform a <i>shr&#257;ddha</i>
at Sidhpur in the name of the deceased wife, after the performance of
which the ghostly presence stopped harassing the new wife of her
husband.<a class="noteref" id="n106.9src" href="#n106.9" name=
"n106.9src">20</a></p>
<p><i>Bhuts</i> and <i>pish&#257;chas</i> are believed by some people
to be immortal, because they are supposed to belong to the order of
demi-gods. In the <i>Amarkosha</i>&mdash;the well-known Sanskrit
lexicon&mdash;they are classed with divinities, such <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e10958" href="#xd26e10958" name=
"xd26e10958">107</a>]</span>as <i>guhyaks</i>, and <i>sidhas</i>. The
<i>bhut</i> is defined as a deity that troubles infants and the
<i>pish&#257;cha</i> as a deity that lives on flesh. <i>Bhuts</i> and
<i>pish&#257;chas</i> are the <i>ganas</i> or attendants of Shiva, one
of the gods of the Hindu Trinity. They are supposed to be
<i>upadevas</i> or demi-gods.</p>
<p><i>Preta</i> is the spirit of a person that dies a sudden or
unnatural death with many of his desires unfulfilled. His soul attains
emancipation by the performance of a <i>sapt&#257;h</i>, that is a
recitation of the <i>Bh&#257;gvat</i> on seven consecutive days. It is
described in the <i>Bh&#257;gvat</i> that Dhundhumari, the brother of
Gokarn, who had become a <i>preta</i>, was released from his
<i>preta</i> existence by the performance of a <i>sapt&#257;h</i> which
his brother caused to be made. The <i>Garudpur&#257;n</i> mentions that
King Babruv&#257;han emancipated a <i>preta</i> by the performance of a
<i>shr&#257;ddha</i>. The <i>mukti</i> or salvation of a <i>preta</i>
is in itself its death. This would prove <i>pretas</i> to be
mortal.<a class="noteref" id="n107.1src" href="#n107.1" name=
"n107.1src">21</a></p>
<p>The span of life of the <i>bhuts</i> and <i>pretas</i> is very long,
but those whose descendants offer them the usual oblations gain their
emancipation sooner. There is a <i>kund</i> or spring called
Zil&#257;nand in the vicinity of Jhinjhuv&#257;d&#257;, on the banks of
which is a temple of Zilakeshwar Mah&#257;dev. The performance of the
<i>pitri shr&#257;ddha</i> by the side of this spring is believed to
expedite the emancipation of the spirits of the deceased from ghostly
life. Every year, on the <i>Bh&#257;darv&#257; am&#257;v&#257;sya</i>,
that is, the new moon day of the month <i>Bh&#257;darv&#257;</i>, a
great fair is held on this spot, when people from long distances visit
the place to get their relatives exorcised by the <i>bhuv&#257;s</i> or
exorcists.</p>
<p>It is believed, that though <i>bhuts</i>, <i>pretas</i> and
<i>pish&#257;chas</i> are immortal, they are scared away by the sound
of a European band and of other musical instruments.<a class="noteref"
id="n107.2src" href="#n107.2" name="n107.2src">22</a> It is said that
all drums and other weird instruments whether European or Indian, have
the power of scaring away evil spirits.</p>
<p>An evil spirit called B&#257;baro had entered the person of the
uncle of M&#257;ldev the king of Jh&#257;l&#257;v&#257;d much to the
king&rsquo;s annoyance. M&#257;ldev offered a stubborn fight to
B&#257;baro, who, unable to cope with M&#257;ldev, promised to extend
his kingdom over those villages in which he would hang up bunting in
one night. It is said that the present extent of the J&#257;hlw&#257;d
territories was due to king M&#257;ldev&rsquo;s enterprise in hanging
up bunting over these territories as asked by B&#257;baro.<a class=

<p>Though at the time of a man&rsquo;s death the faculties may hardly
be sound, yet the <i>v&#257;rsan&#257;</i>&mdash;the
impressions&mdash;left on his mind by his past actions are in
themselves good or bad enough to impress him so as to make his
departing spirit assume a new form of life in keeping with them. For
instance, a man following a particular profession becomes subject to
dreams bearing on that profession. When the impression created by his
actions in daily life is so deep as to induce dreams, his mind, even
after death, leaves to his departing soul an inclination to be engaged
in the subject of his mind&rsquo;s last activities. This is
<i>v&#257;san&#257;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n107.asrc" href=
"#n107.a" name="n107.asrc">24</a></p>
<p>It is a popular saying among Hindus that children inherit the nature
of their parents. It is for this reason that high caste Hindus do not
utter the names of their eldest sons. There is a further belief that
the <i>Pitriyas</i> departed from the world with certain desires
unfulfilled reappear as descendants of their children to have these
desires satisfied.<a class="noteref" id="n107.4src" href="#n107.4"
name="n107.4src">25</a></p>
<p>As the saying goes <i>Pit&#257; putrena j&#257;yate</i>, that is a
father is born in the form of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e11101" href="#xd26e11101" name="xd26e11101">108</a>]</span>son,
so the <i>Pitriyas</i> are born as descendants of their children, or
according to the <i>Bija vrikshany&#257;ya</i>, as a tree springs from
its seed, that is, its offerings, so parents take birth as children of
their offspring.<a class="noteref" id="n108.1src" href="#n108.1" name=
"n108.1src">26</a></p>
<p>The <i>Pitriyas</i>, whose attachment to their children or family or
wealth does not die with them, reappear in the same family as
descendants. It is also believed that persons dying with debts unpaid
with the consciousness that they must be paid, are reborn in this world
for the discharge of their obligations.<a class="noteref" id=
"n108.2src" href="#n108.2" name="n108.2src">27</a></p>
<p>It is not always that the <i>Purvajas</i> reappear in the same
family. It is said about the departed spirits, that after undergoing
punishment for their sins and enjoying the fruits of their good
actions, they come down on earth again as drops of rain, and forming
part of the grain which grows on rain water make their way into the
wombs of animals and are thus reborn.<a class="noteref" id="n108.3src"
href="#n108.3" name="n108.3src">28</a></p>
<p>On account of the community of their feelings, habits and ideas in
previous births, members of different families form different groups.
The actions performed in this life keep them bound to one another
either as recipients of the return of the obligations given in the past
or as givers of fresh obligations. The members of a family stand thus
to one another in the relation of debtors and creditors. It is for the
discharge of these debts and recovery of dues that several individuals
are united in a family. This naturally leads to the members of a family
taking birth again in the same family for the proper discharge of
debts.</p>
<p>A virtuous child is declared to have been born to return the debts
contracted in its past lives, and a vicious one to recover the
dues.<a class="noteref" id="n108.4src" href="#n108.4" name=
"n108.4src">29</a></p>
<p>When an <i>atit</i> or holy man or a recluse dies, his body is
interred, and a platform rising waist high from the ground, or a small
dome-shaped temple, is built over the spot. This is called a
<i>sam&#257;dh</i>. An image of the god Shiva is generally installed in
the <i>sam&#257;dh</i>; but sometimes <i>p&#257;duk&#257;s</i>
<i>i.e.</i> the impressions on stone of the footsteps of the deceased,
are installed instead. Instances of the latter are the
<i>p&#257;duk&#257;s</i> of Datt&#257;traya, Gorakha and Machchendra
N&#257;th.</p>
<p>Both the <i>Sam&#257;dh</i> and the image of the god Shiva as well
as the <i>p&#257;duk&#257;s</i> installed therein, are worshipped by
the people, who, in course of time, give currency to the belief that
the <i>Sam&#257;dh</i> possesses certain miraculous powers, such as
curing long-standing diseases, blessing barren women with children,
etc. Offerings are made to the <i>Sam&#257;dh</i> by pious persons and
festivals or fairs are held in its honour by the inhabitants of the
village in which the <i>Sam&#257;dh</i> is located.<a class="noteref"
id="n108.5src" href="#n108.5" name="n108.5src">30</a></p>
<p><i>Kabars</i> or tombs raised over the graves of Mahomedan saints or
<i>Pirs</i> are held in equal reverence both by Mahomedans and Hindus.
To these offerings are made, and fairs are held in their honour.</p>
<p>Some <i>Sam&#257;dhs</i> and <i>Kabars</i> noted for miraculous
powers are given below.</p>
<p>1. <i>Gorakhn&#257;th</i>:&mdash;The <i>Sam&#257;dh</i> of
Gorakhn&#257;th lies on Mount Girn&#257;r. It is said that when the
word <i>Sal&#257;m</i> is shouted by any one standing on the brink of
the hollow wherein the <i>Sam&#257;dh</i> is said to be, the word
&ldquo;<i>Aleka, Aleka, Aleka</i>&rdquo; is heard in response.<a class=
"noteref" id="n108.6src" href="#n108.6" name="n108.6src">31</a></p>
<p>2. <i>Kevald&#257;s</i>:&mdash;The <i>Sam&#257;dh</i> of
Kevald&#257;s stands in Susav&#257;v. It is told that, on one occasion,
when a festival was being celebrated in honour of the B&#257;v&#257;
Kevald&#257;s, a <i>nimb</i> tree (<span lang="la"><span class="corr"
id="xd26e11226" title="Source: Azadiarchta">Azadirachta</span>
Indica</span>) overhanging the <i>Sam&#257;dh</i> was transformed into
a <i>mitho Limbdo</i> (<span lang="la">Ailantas excelsa</span>).</p>
<p>3. <i>The Sam&#257;dh at K&#257;ng&#257;</i>:&mdash;In the religious
house at K&#257;ng&#257;, a village in the Jun&#257;gadh State, there
lived a <i>b&#257;v&#257;</i> given to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e11248" href="#xd26e11248" name=
"xd26e11248">109</a>]</span>religious austerities. It is said that he
took <i>Sam&#257;dh</i><a class="noteref" id="n109.asrc" href="#n109.a"
name="n109.asrc">32</a> during life. This <i>Sam&#257;dh</i> is said to
work miracles at times.</p>
<p>4. Similarly, a <i>b&#257;v&#257;</i> in the religious house at
Nav&#257;nagar called <i>Sh&#257;rad&#257; Matha</i> has taken a
<i>Sam&#257;dh</i> during life, and his remains and the structure over
them have become an object of worship.</p>
<p>5. <i>The Sam&#257;dh of L&#257;l&#257;
bhakta</i>:&mdash;L&#257;l&#257; bhakta was a native of
S&#257;yol&#257;. He was famous for his piety, and after his death his
<i>Sam&#257;dh</i> was deified. It is said in reference to this
<i>Sam&#257;dh</i> that a meal of dainty dishes prepared for five or
six persons by its side, would satisfy the hunger of a company of
fifty, if one happened to arrive there at the time of serving the
meal<a class="noteref" id="n109.1src" href="#n109.1" name=

<p>6. <i>D&#257;t&#257;r<a class="noteref" id="n109.bsrc" href=
"#n109.b" name="n109.bsrc">34</a> Pir</i>:&mdash;The tomb of this Pir
is situated on Mount Girn&#257;r. Almost all people in
K&#257;thi&#257;w&#257;r and many from Gujar&#257;t offer vows to this
Pir.<a class="noteref" id="n109.2src" href="#n109.2" name=

believed that he has the power of releasing the chain bonds of a person
falsely accused with an offence provided he approaches the <i>Pir</i>
in chains. The sanctity of this <i>Pir</i> is so great that vows in his
honour secure to persons desiring male heirs the birth of
sons.<a class="noteref" id="n109.4src" href="#n109.4" name=

<p>7. <i>As&#257;mi Pir</i>:&mdash;The tomb of this <i>Pir</i> is in
Lun&#257;r. He is believed to ensure the fulfilment of certain vows
made by those who have faith in him.<a class="noteref" id="n109.5src"
href="#n109.5" name="n109.5src">38</a></p>
<p>8. <i>Devalsh&#257; Pir</i>:&mdash;The tomb of this <i>Pir</i> is
situated at Amar&#257;n about seven miles from Todia. Many Hindus
perform the first hair-cutting ceremony of their children at the shrine
of this <i>Pir</i> with an offering of a sweet preparation of ghi,
sugar or molasses, and wheat flour. The Muhammadans distribute cooked
rice among the Fakirs about this shrine.</p>
<p>A tradition runs that, once seven eunuchs defied the power of this
<i>Pir</i> saying that they would put no faith in him unless they
conceived sons. This they did, and when in terror regarding their
approaching confinement, they were told that the children would have to
be taken out by cutting their bodies open. The tombs of these seven
eunuchs and their sons still stand near the tomb of Devalsh&#257; to
bear testimony to his glory and miraculous power.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>9. <i>The Kabar of H&#257;ji Karm&#257;ni</i>:&mdash;Is situated at
Dw&#257;rk&#257;n and is much respected by both Hindus and
Muhammadans.<a class="noteref" id="n109.7src" href="#n109.7" name=
"n109.7src">40</a></p>
<p>10. <i>The tombs of Jesal and Toral</i>:&mdash;These are said to be
the tombs of a husband and wife of the names of Jesal and Toral. They
are situated in Anj&#257;r, a village in Cutch. It is said that
originally these tombs were at the distance of twenty-seven feet from
one another, but now the distance between them is only 7&frac12; feet.
A belief is current that the day of judgment will come when these two
tombs meet.<a class="noteref" id="n109.8src" href="#n109.8" name=

<p>11. <i>H&#257;j Pir and Geb&#257;nsh&#257; Pir</i>:&mdash;The tombs
of these <i>Pirs</i> are at Mendard&#257;. Vows are offered to the
H&#257;j Pir (Pilgrims saint) with the object of securing a good
rainfall after an unusual drought, also for the restoration of stolen
property. Vows to the <span class="corr" id="xd26e11381" title=

<p>12. <i>Panch or Five Pirs</i>:&mdash;The tombs of these <i>Pirs</i>
are situated in Dahur&#257;, each of them measuring about twenty-seven
feet. A miracle is attributed to these tombs in the phenomenon that
they can never be accurately measured, each attempt at measurement
giving a different result. Women whose sons die in infancy make vows in
honour of the Panch Pirs, and take them to their tombs on their
attaining a certain age, where they observe <i>fakiri</i><a class=

days.<a class="noteref" id="n110.1src" href="#n110.1" name=

<p>13. <i>Aulia Pir</i><a class="noteref" id="n110.bsrc" href="#n110.b"
name="n110.bsrc">45</a>:&mdash;The tomb of this <i>Pir</i> lies on
Mount Girn&#257;r. It is believed to possess the miraculous power of
stopping the career of galloping horses and bringing them to the
ground, and of stupefying the senses of a person who enters the
shrine.<a class="noteref" id="n110.2src" href="#n110.2" name=
"n110.2src">46</a></p>
<p>14. <i>Miran D&#257;t&#257;r</i>:&mdash;The celebrated tomb of this
Pir is in the village of Unjh&#257; near Baroda, where a fair is held
every Friday in <i>Shr&#257;van</i>. Persons possessed by evil spirits
are said to be cured by visiting this tomb and offering an image of a
horse stuffed with cotton, and a cocoanut. People from all parts of
Gujar&#257;t and from distant places suffering from physical
infirmities, observe vows in honour of this <i>Pir</i>. Some wear iron
wristlets round their wrists in his honour.<a class="noteref" id=
"n110.3src" href="#n110.3" name="n110.3src">47</a></p>
<p>15. <i>Pir M&#257;h&#257;bali</i>:&mdash;The tomb of this <i>Pir</i>
is situated at Gotark&#257; near R&#257;dhanpur. Every year a fair is
held in honour of this tomb, when the chief Puj&#257;ri of the shrine
of Varalu goes there, holding in one hand a bayonet with its point
touching his breast, and in the other, a cocoanut. It is said that when
the Puj&#257;ri reaches the third step leading to the entrance of the
shrine, the locked doors of the shrine fly open, and the Puj&#257;ri
throws the cocoanut into the shrine. If the shrine gates do not open of
themselves on his approach, the <span class="corr" id="xd26e11456"

<p>16. <i>Kalu Pir</i>:&mdash;It is said that this <i>Pir</i> leads a
procession every night, when monstrous kettle-drums are beaten by his
phantom followers. On every Friday this procession goes on its rounds,
which cover a large area.<a class="noteref" id="n110.5src" href=

<p>The worship of the following Muhammadan Pirs has been adopted by
Hindus:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) D&#257;t&#257;r Pir in Jun&#257;gadh.</p>
<p>(2) D&#257;t&#257;r in R&#257;taiya near Khir&#257;sara.</p>
<p>(3) Gobalsha Pir:&mdash;This Pir is noted for curing boils.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e11506" href="#xd26e11506" name=

<p>(4) T&#257;g Pir or the live saint near
Bh&#257;y&#257;vadar:&mdash;This Pir is believed to have the power of
curing enlargement of the spleen. Persons suffering from this disease
go to his shrine and distribute dry dates among children. This is
supposed to propitiate him and to effect the cure.<a class="noteref"
id="n111.1src" href="#n111.1" name="n111.1src">53</a></p>
<p>(5) Miran D&#257;t&#257;r:&mdash;The miraculous and curative powers
of this Pir are so potent that blind persons are known to have their
eye-sight restored and childless persons to have their longings for
children satisfied through his favour. Persons possessed by evil
spirits are exorcised by merely wearing a ring in his name.<a class=
"noteref" id="n111.2src" href="#n111.2" name="n111.2src">54</a></p>
<p>The shrine of this Pir is situated in the village of Un&#257;va in
the G&#257;ikw&#257;r&rsquo;s territory in North Gujar&#257;t. His
Highness the late G&#257;ikw&#257;r Khander&#257;o has fixed solid
silver railings round the shrine of this Pir in gratitude for a cure
effected by him.</p>
<p>(6) R&#257;mde Pir:&mdash;This Pir has obtained the epithet of
Hindva Pir as he is worshipped mostly by the Hindus. He has worshippers
in many places, where shrines are erected in his honour and verses and
hymns composed and sung in his praise.<a class="noteref" id="n111.3src"
href="#n111.3" name="n111.3src">55</a> He is evidently, as his name
suggests, one of the first Khoja missionaries who practised teachings
more Hindu than Musalm&#257;n in order to secure a following among the
Hindus.</p>
<p>(7) H&#257;ji Karm&#257;ni near Dv&#257;rikh&#257;n.</p>
<p>(8) The D&#257;valsha Pir near Amar&#257;n.</p>
<p>(9) The Lakad Pir and the Hussein Pir in the vicinity of Ganod.</p>
<p>(10) Mah&#257;bali D&#257;da Pir:&mdash;This Pir is to be found
close to the village of Varai. Milk offered to him in his shrine in
<i>ind&#257;s</i> (egg-shaped pots) is said to remain fresh for a year.
Similarly, the doors of his shrine open of themselves after the lapse
of a year.</p>
<p>(11) Mangalio Pir:&mdash;This Pir is worshipped at Dadvi.</p>
<p>(12) Moto Pir:&mdash;Is worshipped at Khandorana.</p>
<p>(13) Hindva Pir:&mdash;This is the Pir of the Khoj&#257;s in
Pir&#257;na near Ahmed&#257;b&#257;d. He is so called because he is
worshipped by the Hindus also.</p>
<p>(14) Bhadi&#257;daro Pir:&mdash;Is in the village of Bh&#257;dia
near Dhor&#257;li.</p>
<p>(15) Ing&#257;r&#257;sha Pir and B&#257;lamsha Pir.</p>
<p>(16) Tamialsha and K&#257;samsha Pir:&mdash;The shrines of these
Pirs are on the <span class="corr" id="xd26e11548" title=

"n111.4src" href="#n111.4" name="n111.4src">56</a></p>
<p>(17) Ganj Pir:&mdash;The shrine of this Pir is near Todia. Vows to
offer a quarter of a pound of molasses to this Pir are believed to be
efficacious in curing persons of fever and children of their
ailments.<a class="noteref" id="n111.5src" href="#n111.5" name=
"n111.5src">57</a></p>
<p>There is a Pir in the village of Vadhardun near Viramg&#257;m.
Persons suspected of having committed thefts are conducted in chains
before this Pir. It is said that, if the charge be false, the chains
break asunder of themselves.<a class="noteref" id="n111.6src" href=
"#n111.6" name="n111.6src">58</a></p>
<p>Apart from the respect paid to the Pirs mentioned above, the Hindus

<p>There are various rural methods in vogue for the cure of
barrenness.</p>
<p>One of these is for the barren woman to swallow the navel-string of
a new-born child.<a class="noteref" id="n112.8src" href="#n112.8" name=
"n112.8src">60</a> Another is to partake of the preparation called
<i>k&#257;tl&#257;n</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n112.1src" href=
"#n112.1" name="n112.1src">61</a></p>
<p>There are two kinds of preparations which go by the name of
<i>k&#257;tl&#257;n</i>. One is prepared from seven pieces of dry
ginger.<a class="noteref" id="n112.2src" href="#n112.2" name=
"n112.2src">62</a> The other is a mixture of <i>suva</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="n112.asrc" href="#n112.a" name="n112.asrc">63</a>
<i>sunth</i> (dry ginger), <i>gundar</i> (gum arabic), <i>gol</i>
(molasses) etc.<a class="noteref" id="n112.3src" href="#n112.3" name=
"n112.3src">64</a> In order to secure the desired effect, the
<i>k&#257;tl&#257;n</i> must be eaten seven times every Sunday or
Tuesday seated on the cot of a woman in child-bed.<a class="noteref"
id="n112.4src" href="#n112.4" name="n112.4src">65</a></p>
<p>The longing for a child is also believed to be satisfied by
partaking of the food served to a woman, in confinement, sitting on her
bed, either on a Sunday or Tuesday.<a class="noteref" id="n112.5src"
href="#n112.5" name="n112.5src">66</a></p>
<p>There is also another preparation which is believed to cause
conception. It consists of a mixture of <i>pitp&#257;pdo</i>
(<span lang="la">Glossocardi Boswellia</span>), sugar-cane and butter.
In order to be efficacious, it must be taken on seven consecutive days
commencing from the fourth day of the monthly menstrual
period.<a class="noteref" id="n112.6src" href="#n112.6" name=
"n112.6src">67</a></p>
<p>Conception is also believed to be favoured by administering the gum
of the <i>b&#257;bul</i> tree dissolved in milk for three days
commencing from the third day of the monthly period.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n112.6">67</a></p>
<p>Some believe that, in order to be effective, this mixture must be
taken standing.<a class="noteref" id="n112.7src" href="#n112.7" name=
"n112.7src">68</a> In some places, seeds of a vegetable plant called
<i>shivalangi</i> are also administered.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n112.6">67</a></p>
<p>To secure conception, a bit of coral is also eaten, with the face
turned towards the sun.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n112.6">67</a></p>
<p>Other preparations taken with the belief that they cause conception
are:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Harde</i> (<span lang="la">Myrobalan</span>) put in
<i>kans&#257;r</i> (a preparation of wheat flour cooked in water and
sweetened with molasses), (2) extract of the fruit called
<i>s&#257;rangdha</i>, (3) <i>p&#257;ras pipalo</i> (<span lang=
"la">Thespesia populnea</span>) mixed with clarified butter,<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n112.8">60</a> (4) gum mixed with plantains, (5)
juice of the cooked leaves of the <i>&#256;rani</i> (<span lang=
"la">Elaeodendren glaucum</span>),<a class="noteref" id="n112.9src"
href="#n112.9" name="n112.9src">69</a> (6) powder of <i>N&#257;g
kesar</i> (<span lang="la">Messua ferrea</span>) put into milk, and (7)
the roots of <i>Bhong ringdi</i> (a kind of poisonous plant) mixed with
the milk of a cow.<a class="noteref" id="n112.10src" href="#n112.10"
name="n112.10src">70</a></p>
<p>It is also believed that if a barren woman succeeds in carrying away
grains of rice from the folds of the upper garment of a pregnant woman,
and eats them cooked in milk, her desire for a child is
satisfied.<a class="noteref" id="n112.11src" href="#n112.11" name=
"n112.11src">71</a></p>
<p>In celebrating the <i>Sim&#257;nt</i> or first pregnancy ceremony of
a woman, the pregnant woman is taken for a bath to a dung-hill or to a
distance of about thirty yards behind the house. After the bath is
over, she returns home walking over sheets of cloth spread on her way.
On this occasion her company is coveted by barren women for the purpose
of tearing off unseen a piece of her upper garment, as this is believed
to bring about conception. It is said that if a woman succeeds in doing
this, she conceives, while the victim has a miscarriage.<a class=
"noteref" id="n112.12src" href="#n112.12" name="n112.12src">72</a></p>
<p>Some believe that a slight pressure by a childless woman on the
upper garment of a pregnant woman is sufficient to bring about the
result mentioned above.<a class="noteref" id="n112.13src" href=
"#n112.13" name="n112.13src">73</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e11730" href="#xd26e11730" name="xd26e11730">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>Others hold that a slight blow on the shoulder of a pregnant woman
by a childless woman satisfies the desire of the latter for a
child.<a class="noteref" id="n113.1src" href="#n113.1" name=
"n113.1src">74</a></p>
<p>Conception is also said to be effected by branding children while at
play in the streets.<a class="noteref" id="n113.2src" href="#n113.2"
name="n113.2src">75</a></p>
<p>It is believed that this brand, to have efficacy, must be inflicted
on a Sunday or Tuesday.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n113.2">75</a>
The operation is generally performed in the evening with a red-hot
needle. It is said that the branded child dies while the branding
barren woman conceives a child.<a class="noteref" id="n113.3src" href=
"#n113.3" name="n113.3src">76</a></p>
<p>Offering bread to black dogs is also supposed to be a cure for
barrenness.</p>
<p>Conception is also favoured by passing under the bier or palanquin
holding the corpse of an ascetic or holy man while it is being carried
to the cemetery.<a class="noteref" id="n113.4src" href="#n113.4" name=
"n113.4src">77</a> Some believe that such an ascetic or saint must be a
follower of the Jain faith.<a class="noteref" id="n113.5src" href=
"#n113.5" name="n113.5src">78</a> Others maintain that the desired end
can be secured only by wearing round the elbows the grains of rice or
coins offered to the bier of a saint on its way to the
cemetery.<a class="noteref" id="n113.6src" href="#n113.6" name=
"n113.6src">79</a></p>
<p>Other methods practised for the cure of barrenness are as
follows:</p>
<p>The barren woman cuts off a lock of the hair of a child-bearing
woman and keeps it in her custody.<a class="noteref" id="n113.7src"
href="#n113.7" name="n113.7src">80</a></p>
<p>Some women collect the dust trodden on by a child-bearing woman in
an earthen pot and eat it every day till it is exhausted.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n113.7">80</a></p>
<p>Some throw grains of <i>adad</i> (Phaseolus mungo) over the bed of a
woman in confinement.<a class="noteref" id="n113.asrc" href="#n113.a"
name="n113.asrc">81</a></p>
<p>Others daub their foreheads with the blood emitted by a woman in
menses.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n113.7">80</a></p>
<p>There are some who pour water in a circle at the village gate on a
Sunday or Tuesday, and when in period, partake of the powder of
<i>mindhal</i> mixed with <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e11797" title=
"Source: l&aacute;psi">l&#257;psi</span></i> (coarse wheat flour fried
in <i>ghi</i> and sweetened with molasses or sugar) seated on the
threshold of the house.<a class="noteref" id="n113.8src" href="#n113.8"
name="n113.8src">82</a></p>
<p>Many wear round their necks leaves called <i>bhojapatras</i> on
which the mystical figure given below is drawn by an exorcist.</p>
<div class="figure p099width"><img src="images/p099.png" alt=

<p>Pieces of paper on which the following <i>jantra</i> is written by

round the elbows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Sw&#257;h&#257; aum rhin kling

</div>
<p class="first">About a month and a quarter after the delivery of a
woman, a ceremony called <i>zarm&#257;n zarv&#257;n</i> is performed,
when the woman goes to a neighbouring stream or well to fetch water for
the first time after her delivery. Near the stream or well five small
heaps of sand are made and daubed with red lead. Next, a lamp fed with
<i>ghi</i> is lighted, and seven small betelnuts are offered to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e11833" href="#xd26e11833" name=
"xd26e11833">114</a>]</span>stream or well. A cocoanut is then broken,
and a part of it is thrown into the water as an offering. Next, the
woman fills a jar with the water of the stream or well and returns
home, taking with her six out of the seven betelnuts offered to the
stream or well. On her way home she is approached by barren women who
request to be favoured with one of the betelnuts, as it is believed
that swallowing such a betelnut causes conception.<a class="noteref"
id="n114.1src" href="#n114.1" name="n114.1src">83</a></p>
<p>Some believe that only the smallest of the seven betelnuts has the
power of producing this result<a class="noteref" id="n114.2src" href=
"#n114.2" name="n114.2src">84</a>. Others hold that this betelnut must
be swallowed on the threshold of a house.<a class="noteref" id=
"n114.3src" href="#n114.3" name="n114.3src">85</a></p>
<p>Eating cocoa-kernel and molasses sitting on the threshold of the
house on the fourth day of the monthly period is also believed to be a
remedy for the cure of barrenness.</p>
<p>Placing a box containing a <i>kori</i>, (a small silver coin) on a
spot where three roads cross one another is also said to favour
conception.<a class="noteref" id="n114.4src" href="#n114.4" name=
"n114.4src">86</a></p>
<p>In some places, a black earthen pot containing charcoal and grains
of <i>adad</i> (Phaseolus mungo) is placed on a spot where two roads
cross one another, on a Sunday or Tuesday. On this day the barren woman
has to take her meals without salt.<a class="noteref" id="n114.5src"
href="#n114.5" name="n114.5src">87</a></p>
<p>Cutting off a lock of a child&rsquo;s hair and keeping it in custody
is also believed to satisfy the longing of a barren woman for a child.
This result can also be obtained by securing a piece of a garment of a
suckling child.</p>
<p>Some worship daily a cocoanut and a betelnut consecrated with
incantations.<a class="noteref" id="n114.6src" href="#n114.6" name=
"n114.6src">88</a></p>
<p>Some take a bath on the third day of their period, and stand on the
threshold of the house with their hair sprinkled over with
<i>kankotri</i> (red powder). Next, a <i>ghi</i>-fed lamp is offered to
the deities, and the devotee prostrates herself before the
lamp.<a class="noteref" id="n114.7src" href="#n114.7" name=
"n114.7src">89</a></p>
<p>It is also believed that barrenness can be cured by religious vows,
by offering alms in propitiation of malignant planets such as Mars, and
by reciting the <i>jap</i> or incantation called <i>gop&#257;l
sant&#257;n</i> to please the deity of that name.<a class="noteref" id=
"n114.8src" href="#n114.8" name="n114.8src">90</a></p>
<p>One of the religious vows of this nature is to observe<a id=
"xd26e11896" name="xd26e11896"></a> fasts on twelve consecutive Sundays
or Tuesdays. On these days the devotee fixes her gaze on the sun and
offers him worship, after which she takes a meal prepared in milk
without salt or sugar.<a class="noteref" id="n114.9src" href="#n114.9"
name="n114.9src">91</a></p>
<p>Some hold a recitation of the <i>chandi kavach</i> a hundred times
through Br&#257;hmans with sacrificial oblations of clarified butter,
sesamum seed, <i>kamod</i> (a kind of rice), <i>gugal</i>
(rhododendron), sandal wood and sugarcandy.<a class="noteref" id=
"n114.10src" href="#n114.10" name="n114.10src">92</a> Others have the
story of the <i>Harivansha</i> recited on seventeen consecutive days,
during which period the devotee (<i>i.e.</i>, the barren woman)
observes <i>brahmacharya</i><span class="corr" id="xd26e11924" title=
"Not in source">,</span> that is abstains from sexual enjoyment. This
ceremony is believed to exorcise the fiend of barrenness.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n114.10">92</a></p>
<p>Some keep a vow of standing on their legs for the whole day on the
fourteenth of the month of <i>Ph&#257;lgun</i> (the fifth month of the
Gujar&#257;t Hindu year) and of breaking their fast after worshipping
the sacred pyre.<a class="noteref" id="n114.11src" href="#n114.11"
name="n114.11src">93</a></p>
<p>There is another vow called the <i>Punema</i> or full-moon day vow,
the observance of which is believed to favour the birth of a
son.<a class="noteref" id="n114.12src" href="#n114.12" name=

<p>Pouring water at the root of, or circumambulating, a <i>pipal</i> or
<i>b&#257;bul</i> tree after a bath without removing the wet clothes,
is also believed to cause conception.<a class="noteref" id="n115.1src"
href="#n115.1" name="n115.1src">95</a></p>
<p>Some observe the vow of entertaining thirteen Br&#257;hmans and
thirteen virgins to a feast, and of setting up Randal Bantva.<a class=
"noteref" id="n115.2src" href="#n115.2" name="n115.2src">96</a></p>
<p>Women whose children die in infancy give them opprobrious names such
as Khacharo (filth), Ghelo (stupid), Natho, Uko, Ukardo, Bodho, Pujo,
Ad&#257;vo, Mongho, Tulhi, Tutho, Kadavi, etc. in the belief that by so
doing the life of the children is lengthened.<a class="noteref" id=
"n115.3src" href="#n115.3" name="n115.3src">97</a> The idea is almost
Asiatic in extent. Among Musalm&#257;ns also such names are given; and
even among the Persians and Arabs boys are given such names as Masriequ
and Osaid&mdash;the Stolen and the Black. Sometimes parents arrange
that their <span class="corr" id="xd26e11969" title=
"Source: childern">children</span> be actually stolen; and some next of
kin, generally the aunt, is made to commit the kindly felony. She
afterwards returns the child for a certain amount in cash or clothes.
The custom is as old as the scriptures, there being an allusion in the
Kor&#257;n to how the little Joseph was made to steal some garment of
his aunt and was claimed as a forfeit by her. Speaking about Levi, the
older brothers of Joseph say to the Egyptian soldiers, &ldquo;If he
hath stolen (the king&rsquo;s goblet) verily the brother of his too did
(formerly) steal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some make a vow of not cutting the hair of their children till they
are taken to Amb&#257;ji, where their hair is cut for the first
time.<a class="noteref" id="n115.4src" href="#n115.4" name=

<p>Some treat their children as beggars until they attain the age of

<p class="first">The beliefs current as to the cause of dreams are
many. One of these is that memory of known facts or incidents heard or
seen causes dreams. Dreams are also supposed to be caused by disorders
in the brain, by brooding constantly over a particular occurrence, by
anxiety or by the perpetration of sinful acts.<a class="noteref" id=
"n116.1src" href="#n116.1" name="n116.1src">1</a> Those who are
indebted to the <i>pitris</i> (ancestral spirits) are also said to be
troubled by dreams.<a class="noteref" id="n116.2src" href="#n116.2"
name="n116.2src">2</a> A hearty meal at night just before going to bed
is also supposed to cause dreams.<a class="noteref" id="n116.3src"
href="#n116.3" name="n116.3src">3</a></p>
<p>There are three conditions of human existence, (1)
<i>J&#257;griti</i> that is wakefulness (2) <i>Swapna</i> that is dream
and (3) <i>Sushupti</i> that is sleep. The incidents which impress the
mind strongly during wakefulness are reproduced in dreams. Very often
thoughts that never occur to our minds strike us in dreams. These are
ascribed to the impressions made on the soul during past
lives.<a class="noteref" id="n116.4src" href="#n116.4" name=
"n116.4src">4</a></p>
<p>It is said that the interpretation of dreams goes by contraries. But
at times they are fully borne out. A good dream is an indication of
future good, and a bad one of future evil.<a class="noteref" id=
"n116.5src" href="#n116.5" name="n116.5src">5</a></p>
<p>There are some persons whose dreams are always fulfilled. Dreams
dreamt by persons pure of mind and heart seldom turn out false.</p>
<p>Dreams occurring in the first quarter of the night are believed to
be fulfilled in a year, those in the second quarter of the night in six
months, those in the third quarter in three months, and those in the
last quarter in one month. A dream seen during an hour and a half
before daybreak bears fruit in ten days, while that seen just at
day-break is realised immediately.<a class="noteref" id="n116.6src"
href="#n116.6" name="n116.6src">6</a></p>
<p>Dreams that occur before midnight are never fulfilled.<a class=
"noteref" id="n116.7src" href="#n116.7" name="n116.7src">7</a></p>
<p>If a person has a bad dream, he should go to sleep at once, and not
communicate it to any one. If he has a good dream, he should not sleep
on that night after its occurrence. Early on the following morning he
should communicate it to a preceptor or saint; but if neither be
available, he should repeat it into the ears of a cow. A good dream
should never be told to a bad or low-minded person.</p>
<p>If a man sleeps after a good dream and has a bad one, the former
loses its force while the latter gains ascendancy and comes
true.<a class="noteref" id="n116.8src" href="#n116.8" name=
"n116.8src">8</a></p>
<p>It is related that All&#257;uddin the bloody once entered the house
of a blacksmith when the latter was asleep dreaming that he saw a
treasure trove after having bathed in a stream and drunk a little
water. At the same time All&#257;uddin saw a small insect come
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e12042" href="#xd26e12042" name=
"xd26e12042">117</a>]</span>out of the blacksmith&rsquo;s nostril,
drink water from a neighbouring cistern, and return to the place from
whence he came. When the dream was over, the blacksmith woke and
communicated it to All&#257;uddin, which enabled the latter to spot the
treasure, found by excavating the place where the insect was
hidden.<a class="noteref" id="n117.1src" href="#n117.1" name=
"n117.1src">9</a></p>
<p>The king Nala was questioned in his sleep several times by an
individual unknown to him, &ldquo;May I come now or later?&rdquo; Nala
replied &ldquo;Come now&rdquo; thinking that if it was misfortune that
put him the question, it would be better to get rid of it soon, so that
the latter part of life might be passed happily. The questioner proved
to be misfortune, and it is related that Nala met many mishaps during
his youth.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n117.1">9</a></p>
<p>Similarly, a bad dream dreamt by Harischandra was followed by a
series of calamities.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n117.1">9</a></p>
<p>R&#257;van, the demon king of Lanka or Ceylon, had a dream in the
third quarter of the night that Lanka was destroyed, and the
destruction of Lanka followed.<a class="noteref" id="n117.2src" href=
"#n117.2" name="n117.2src">10</a></p>
<p>To see or think or experience in dreams the following, as the case
may be is considered to be auspicious:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) A cow, (2) a bullock, (3) an elephant, (4) a palace, (5) a

a woman dressed in white, (27) walking over a layer of lead, (28)
lifting a goblet filled with wine, (29) a lion, (30) the goddess of
wealth, (31) a garland, (32) driving in a carriage to which an
elephant, a lion, a horse or a bullock is yoked, (33) swallowing the
disc of the sun or the moon, (34) the hands or feet of a man, (35)
worship of a deity, (36) barley, (37) rice, (38) sandal paste, (39) the
<i>Dro</i> grass (<span lang="la">Cynodon Dactylon</span>), (40) the
moon, (41) the sun, (42) a goblet, (43) an ocean of milk, (44) jewels,
(45) smokeless fire, (46) an image of the god Shiva, Brahma or Ganesh

(49) the <i>Kalpavriksha</i> or the magic tree that satisfies all
desires, (50) a river in floods, (51) fish, (52) curdled milk, (53)
going on a pilgrimage, (54) ornaments, (55) crossing a river, (56)
eating the flesh of a man&rsquo;s legs or flowers.<a class="noteref"

<p>To see in a dream (1) a person leading a life of celibacy, (2) a
virgin, (3) a green tree, (4) or students returning from school, is
also considered to foretell good <span class="corr" id="xd26e12091"
title="Source: fotune">fortune</span>.<a class="noteref" id="n117.4src"
href="#n117.4" name="n117.4src">12</a></p>
<p>Similarly, the sight of an unwidowed woman and the thought of the
death of any person, in a dream, is believed to bring good
luck.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n117.4">12</a></p>
<p>A dream in which one of the following objects is seen is also
supposed to be good:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e12105" title="Source: 1.">(1)</span> An
assemblage of Br&#257;hmans, (2) a gardener, (3) milk, (4) a
prostitute, (5) a shield and sword, (6) a musket, (7) a scimitar, (8)
an antelope, (9) an unwidowed woman carrying on her head a jar filled
with water, (10) a mongoose, (11) a peacock, (12) a woman carrying a
child on her waist, (13) newly-washed dry clothes, (14) a costly fan,
(15) a man dressed in white clothes.<a class="noteref" id="n117.5src"
href="#n117.5" name="n117.5src">13</a></p>
<p>In a book called <i>Harit-sanhita</i> the subject of the influence
of dreams on human happiness or misery is fully treated.</p>
<p>The book says:&mdash;If the sun, the moon, the congregation of the
stars, a lake filled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e12121" href=
"#xd26e12121" name="xd26e12121">118</a>]</span>with clusters of
expanded lotuses, or crossing the sea or a river full of water be seen
or experienced in a dream by a man, he attains wealth, happiness and
prosperity and relief from diseases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a cow, a horse, an elephant, a king or a flower called
<i>prashasta</i> is seen in a dream by a sickly person, his illness
disappears; if by one laid in sick bed, he is cured; if by one confined
in a jail, he is released.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="n118.1src"
href="#n118.1" name="n118.1src">14</a></p>
<p>If a child grinds its teeth and weeps in a dream, it indicates
liquidation of pecuniary liabilities. One who sees a man die in a dream
is blessed with longevity.<a class="noteref" id="n118.2src" href=
"#n118.2" name="n118.2src">15</a></p>
<p>A bite by a white snake in a dream is an omen of increase of
wealth.<a class="noteref" id="n118.3src" href="#n118.3" name=

<p>&ldquo;All black objects except a cow, a horse, a king, an elephant,
and fish, seen in a dream, are the precursors of disease and
calamity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One who sees in a dream his body devoured by crows, herons,
camels, serpents, boars, eagles, foxes, dogs, wolves, asses, buffaloes,
birds moving in the sky, tigers, fishes, alligators or monkeys,

<p>The following objects seen, heard or experienced in a dream are
believed to forebode evil:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e12154" title="Source: 1.">(1)</span>
Cotton, (2) ashes, (3) bones, (4) whey, (5) singing, (6) merriment, (7)

<p>If in a dream one relishes a dish of sweetmeats, plays upon a
musical instrument, or sees a widow dressed in the garment of an
unwidowed woman, it is believed to prognosticate evil and bring
misfortune.</p>
<p>Similarly, if in a dream, the sleeper marries or hears the crowing
of a crow or the bark of a dog, or an owl speak like a man, it portends
misfortune<span class="corr" id="xd26e12176" title=
"Not in source">.</span><a class="noteref" id="n118.6src" href=
"#n118.6" name="n118.6src">19</a></p>
<p>Seeing an auspicious mark, or bathing in or being besmeared with
oil, in a dream, is an indication of one&rsquo;s death in the near
future. Going to the south riding a he-buffalo, or seeing a widow,
brings on misfortune.<a class="noteref" id="n118.7src" href="#n118.7"
name="n118.7src">20</a></p>
<p>If a man in health comes across a corpse in a dream, he apprehends
illness. If a patient does the same, he fears death.<a class="noteref"
id="n118.8src" href="#n118.8" name="n118.8src">21</a></p>
<p>It is a common belief that the soul can leave the body
temporarily.</p>
<p>When a man feels thirsty in sleep, his soul is supposed to leave the
body to drink water, and if it finds the water pots covered, not to
return to the body, which is found dead the next morning.<a class=
"noteref" id="n118.asrc" href="#n118.a" name="n118.asrc">22</a> It is
for this reason that most people drink water at the time of going to

<p>Shankar&#257;ch&#257;rya was a life long celibate. Once, in a
discussion with the wife of Mandan Mishra, she put to him a question on
the subject of the pleasures of married life. To answer the question it
was necessary to have the experiences of a married life. To
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e12204" href="#xd26e12204" name=
"xd26e12204">119</a>]</span>gain these experiences
Shankar&#257;ch&#257;rya&rsquo;s soul left his body and entered the
corpse of a king just dead, and enjoyed the pleasures of married life
for six months in the company of the queen of the deceased king. It
then returned to his body, which was preserved by his disciples
according to his instructions, and answered the question put to him by
the wife of Mandan Mishra.<a class="noteref" id="n119.1src" href=
"#n119.1" name="n119.1src">24</a></p>
<p>It is related that the spirit of the daughter of a black-smith in
Luvaria returned to her body two hours after her death, after which she
lived for a fortnight.</p>
<p>A similar story is told of a N&#257;gar Br&#257;hman, who lived for
some years after the return of his spirit to his body.<a class=
"noteref" id="n119.2src" href="#n119.2" name="n119.2src">25</a></p>
<p>About forty years ago, the corpse of a Kanbi in Lil&#257;pur was
carried to the burning ground for cremation, and there his spirit
returned to his body. On being asked where he had been, the Kanbi
replied that he had been to Dharmar&#257;ja, the lord of hell, who told
him to go back to his body, saying that his life&rsquo;s thread had not
yet ended. It is related that the Kanbi lived for some years after this
incident.</p>
<p>Another instance of the soul departing and then returning to the
body is that of a Kanbi woman in Lil&#257;pur, whose soul returned to
the body after she had been carried to the burning ground. The woman
lived for five years after this occurrence.<a class="noteref" id=
"n119.3src" href="#n119.3" name="n119.3src">26</a></p>
<p>A Br&#257;hman in Limbdi named Vaijn&#257;th had, by the performance
of <i>yoga</i>, obtained the power of sending his spirit out of his
body and recalling it at pleasure.<a class="noteref" id="n119.4src"
href="#n119.4" name="n119.4src">27</a></p>
<p>The soul of a living being leaves its physical tabernacle during
sleep and hovers about. It can go to and return from even the heavenly
and infernal regions.</p>
<p>There are eighteen kinds of <i>siddhis</i> or accomplishments, one
of which is <i>parak&#257;y&#257;pravesh</i> or the power of entering
the body of another and returning to one&rsquo;s own body at will. The
soul cannot exist separated from the body. When a person who revives
after death is asked how he returned to life, he declares that he has
been carried to the presence of the god of death by his messengers,
being mistaken for another bearing the same name and living in the same
locality. When such a mistake is detected, the god of death tells the
soul of the man concerned that his life&rsquo;s span has not yet ended,
and sends it back to the body, which appears to be dead.<a class=
"noteref" id="n119.5src" href="#n119.5" name="n119.5src">28</a></p>
<p>Often the soul of a man ascends to his temples, when the man is
supposed to be dead although he is alive. In such cases, when the soul
descends, the man is supposed to come to life again.</p>
<p>It is believed by some people that if all the desires of a man are
not satisfied at the time of his death, his soul leaves the body to
satisfy them and subsequently returns to the corpse, whereupon the body
revives.<a class="noteref" id="n119.6src" href="#n119.6" name=
"n119.6src">29</a></p>
<p>A devotee in his meditative trance can send forth his soul
whithersoever he pleases.<a class="noteref" id="n119.7src" href=
"#n119.7" name="n119.7src">30</a></p>
<p>It is also believed that the soul of man leaves the body in sleep to
enjoy those pleasures which it cannot enjoy in wakefulness.<a class=
"noteref" id="n119.8src" href="#n119.8" name="n119.8src">31</a></p>
<p>The popular conceptions of the character and functions of the
<i>bhut</i> or disembodied soul are as follows:</p>
<p>A ghost has no recognised form. It may assume the form of a human
being, a goat, a blaze of fire, a whirl-wind or any other object it
pleases.<a class="noteref" id="n119.9src" href="#n119.9" name=
"n119.9src">32</a></p>
<p>Some assume a terribly gigantic and fearfully uncouth frame, with
big fang-like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e12274" href=
"#xd26e12274" name="xd26e12274">120</a>]</span>teeth, long matted hair
and a height that reaches the sky. At times they assume the form of a
child and cry heart-breakingly at a concealed corner of a road. Should
a passer-by, out of compassion, try to save it, the supposed infant
begins to lengthen its legs to show its benefactor its real and
supernatural dimensions. Sometimes it transforms itself into a gigantic
and terrible being, taking possession of the man if he becomes
afraid.<a class="noteref" id="n120.1src" href="#n120.1" name=
"n120.1src">33</a></p>
<p>Some evil spirits manifest themselves as showers of burning
charcoal, while some are so forward as to offer their services as
guides to strangers from one village to another. Some assume the form
of <i>Bhens&#257;sur</i>&mdash;a demon in the form of a
buffalo&mdash;said to be a most malignant ghost.<a class="noteref" id=
"n120.2src" href="#n120.2" name="n120.2src">34</a></p>
<p>The throat of a ghost is as narrow as the fine end of a needle, and
yet it is believed to require a dozen potfuls of water to quench its
thirst. It cannot get pure water, as such water is guarded by the god
Varuna. It has, therefore, to quench its thirst with such dirty water
as it can get. Similarly, it cannot get clean food, and has to satisfy
its hunger on human excretions, the droppings of birds and other
animals, urine, and the filth of houses.<a class="noteref" id=
"n120.3src" href="#n120.3" name="n120.3src">35</a></p>
<p>It is generally believed that evil spirits do not cast shadows. All
attempts to catch them prove futile, as they vanish in the form of a
flame.<a class="noteref" id="n120.4src" href="#n120.4" name=
"n120.4src">36</a></p>
<p>If it is sought to catch hold of a goat-shaped ghost, the goat
swells into such a monstrous size that the spectator gets terrified,
whereupon the ghost finds an opportunity of disappearing in a
flame.</p>
<p>It is believed that ghosts prefer darkness to light and silence to
noise. They live on the <i>Pipal</i> (<span lang="la">Ficus
religiosa</span>) or <i>Shami</i> (<span lang="la">Prosopis
spicigera</span>) trees.<a class="noteref" id="n120.5src" href=
"#n120.5" name="n120.5src">37</a></p>
<p>A ghost presents itself to the vision of a man by blocking its way
in the form of a goat or some other animal.<a class="noteref" id=
"n120.6src" href="#n120.6" name="n120.6src">38</a></p>
<p>Ghosts are believed to infest woods, unused wells, cellars and old
tanks. They are also found in ruins and cemeteries. As far as possible
they keep themselves aloof from mortals; but at times they are visible
to human beings, mostly to those destitute of religion and morals. They
roam about and terrify people. Sometimes they enter the persons of
human beings. Such men either gain in strength, fall sick, or become

possessed.<a class="noteref" id="n120.7src" href="#n120.7" name=

<p>Often a large concourse of ghosts meet together and dance, sing and
make merry uttering loud and fierce shrieks. A ghost has no back, and
has its feet reversed. It keeps away from man, but terrifies him by
pelting him with stones from a distance.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Ghosts enter corpses or possess human beings and speak through them
as a medium. Sometimes they assume their original human form, and often
torment people with disease. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e12358"
href="#xd26e12358" name="xd26e12358">121</a>]</span>They present
themselves as animals and pass away in a blaze. They hum in the air
without being seen, wrestle with men or carry unseen human beings from
one place to another. Some women are believed to conceive by
intercourse with male ghosts.<a class="noteref" id="n121.1src" href=

<p>If a man happens to step in the circle described by water round the
offering given to a ghost, viz., <i>ut&#257;r</i>, he is possessed by
the ghost. A house haunted by a ghost is the scene of great
mischief.<a class="noteref" id="n121.2src" href="#n121.2" name=
"n121.2src">45</a></p>
<p>Ghosts are said to be most mischievous during the first part of the
night. Their fury diminishes with the advance of night.<a class=
"noteref" id="n121.3src" href="#n121.3" name="n121.3src">46</a></p>
<p>Ghosts are inimical to human beings, terrify them, and sometimes,
assuming the form of a cobra, kill those whom they hated most during
life.<a class="noteref" id="n121.4src" href="#n121.4" name=

<p>The ghost called <i>J&#257;n</i> manifests itself as a giant, its
height reaching the sky. If a man comes under its shadow, he is seized
by it and dashed to pieces on the ground. On the contrary, if a man
wins its favour, he becomes prosperous. Hence a proverb has been
current that &ldquo;seizing another as by a <i>j&#257;n</i>&rdquo;
meaning &ldquo;being attacked by a dire misfortune.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="n121.asrc" href="#n121.a" name="n121.asrc">50</a></p>
<p>There is a female ghost called <i>Chudel</i>. Its back is covered
with flesh, its feet are reversed, its form is hollow and its face
handsome like that of a charming woman.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>It is said that a woman dying in childbed becomes a <i>chudel</i>.
Her form is a skeleton behind with the figure of a pretty woman in
front.</p>
<p>It is believed that mastery over ghosts can be obtained by dint of
incantations or <i>mantras</i>. Those who subjugate ghosts in this way
have power to command them to do their behests. But the process by
which such powers are procured is believed to be beset with dangers,
and many lose their lives in so doing.<a class="noteref" id="n121.8src"
href="#n121.8" name="n121.8src">52</a></p>
<p>There is also a belief that a <i>bhut</i> or ghost can be brought
under control by lopping off a lock of its hair or top knot and keeping
it in one&rsquo;s custody.<a class="noteref" id="n121.9src" href=
"#n121.9" name="n121.9src">53</a></p>
<p>It is said that this lock ought to be kept inside the right thigh by
tearing a hole in the flesh. It is believed that the thigh can be cut
open by a hair of the ghost without injury.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The ghost so subjugated should never be kept unemployed; otherwise
it oppresses its master.<a class="noteref" id="n121.11src" href=

<p>It is believed that the spirits of deceased persons become ghosts
under the following conditions:&mdash;</p>
<p>1 If scriptural ceremonies are not performed with the ceremonial
offerings of rice balls to the deceased.</p>
<p>2 If the deceased dies with a strong attachment to worldly
objects.</p>
<p>3 If the death is unnatural that is, caused by an accident.</p>
<p>All ghosts get absolution by the performance of propitiative
ceremonies by their descendants as prescribed in the
scriptures.<a class="noteref" id="n121.12src" href="#n121.12" name=

<p>There are various beliefs current as to the state of the soul after
death. The <i>Garud pur&#257;n</i> contains many passages illustrating
its movements after it leaves the body. Says the book:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the soul leaves the body it assumes a form as small as a
thumb. At this very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e12475" href=
"#xd26e12475" name="xd26e12475">122</a>]</span>moment it is caught by
the servants of Yama while he is crying out ha! ha! looking at its
corporal receptacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Covering the body of the soul (which suffers intensely) and
strangling it forcibly, the servants of the god Yama carry it away just
as a culprit is carried by a king&rsquo;s soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The verses that follow describe the miseries inflicted upon the poor
thumb-shaped soul for the sins committed by him during his life-time.
The sinful soul has to undergo similar miseries in hell. From hell it
returns to this world guarded by the servants of Yama, to partake of
the rice-balls and other articles of food offered by the sons or other
relatives. It is then again taken to hell to suffer more miseries and
penalties in expiation of past sins. Then it returns once more to
receive the offerings of rice-balls made at <i>shr&#257;ddha</i>
ceremonies. If, even after this, any desires remain unfulfilled, it has
to continue a wretched existence in the other world.<a class="noteref"
id="n122.1src" href="#n122.1" name="n122.1src">57</a></p>
<p>In a chapter of the <i>Pretamanjari</i> of the <i>Garud
Pur&#257;n</i> it is stated that the souls of righteous men go to the
next world unmolested.<a class="noteref" id="n122.2src" href="#n122.2"
name="n122.2src">58</a></p>
<p>Some people believe that the departing soul assumes a form like a
thumb, and remains in that state until relieved by the performance of
<i>shr&#257;ddha</i> by his heirs. It then enters the other world to
enjoy the fruits of its good actions. The <i>Yamapuri</i> or the city
of the god of death is 8,6&acute;0 <i>Y&#333;jans</i>&mdash;a
<i>Y&#333;jan</i> being equal to four miles&mdash;to the south of the
earth. The lord of this place is Dharmar&#257;ja. Yama is his servant,
whose duty is to carry the soul from one place to another.<a class=
"noteref" id="n122.3src" href="#n122.3" name="n122.3src">59</a></p>
<p>Others maintain that two states await the soul after death according
to whether it has performed righteous or sinful acts during life.</p>
<p>The righteous attain to heaven and enter the <i>P&#257;rshad
Vaikunta</i> of Vishnu. The sinful go to hell or
<i>Yamaloka</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n122.4src" href="#n122.4" name=
"n122.4src">60</a></p>
<p>The sinful souls go to <i>Yamaloka</i> and are made to suffer the
miseries of twenty-eight <i>naraks</i> or hells in proportion to the
sins perpetrated by them, after which they return to the earth.</p>
<p>The following are some of the punishments meted out to wicked souls
for their sins, in their next lives:&mdash;</p>
<p>1 Those who murder Br&#257;hmans suffer from consumption.</p>
<p>2 Those who slaughter cows are born as tortoises.</p>
<p>3 Those guilty of female infanticide suffer from white leprosy.</p>
<p>4 One who kills his wife, as well as a woman guilty of causing
abortion, becomes a beggar.</p>
<p>5 Those who commit adultery become impotent.</p>
<p>6 He who seats himself on the bed or seat of his preceptor is
affected by skin diseases.</p>
<p>7 Flesh-eaters get a red body.</p>
<p>8 Those who indulge in drink get black teeth.</p>
<p>9 A Br&#257;hman partaking of prohibited food suffers from
dropsy.</p>
<p>10 One who eats sweets without sharing them with the by-standers
suffers from cancer in the throat.</p>
<p>11 One who offers polluted food to departed spirits suffers from
black leprosy.</p>
<p>12 One who disobeys and despises his teacher suffers from wind
<i>apasm&#257;r</i>.</p>
<p>13 One who does not believe in the <i>sh&#257;stras</i> suffers from
enlargement of the spleen or Bright&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>14 A perjurer is born dumb. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>15 One who does not serve food equally to all the members at a
dining table loses one of his eyes.</p>
<p>16 Those who break off a marriage alliance are punished with thick
(negro-like) lips.</p>
<p>17 Those who steal books lose their eye-sight.</p>
<p>18 He who kicks a Br&#257;hman becomes lame.</p>
<p>19 A liar becomes a stammerer.</p>
<p>20 Those who listen to contradictory versions of what is generally
believed to be true become deaf.</p>
<p>21 One who poisons another becomes a lunatic.</p>
<p>22 One who steals precious metals becomes indigent.</p>
<p>23 An incendiary is punished with a bald head.</p>
<p>24 Meat-sellers meet with misfortunes.</p>

<p>The state of the soul after death depends upon a man&rsquo;s good or
bad actions in life.</p>
<p>The souls of the righteous leave the body without any trouble. The
messengers of the god of death present themselves to these souls in the
form of saints and carry them to that part of the heaven which is
presided over by their favourite deity, by the eastern, northern, or
western gates. They are received there with great respect. Here they
enjoy the fruits of their merit, after which they return to this world
and are born either in the family of a wealthy virtuous man or in that
of a poor Br&#257;hman who has attained the knowledge of God. In this
new life they accumulate further merit, in virtue of which they are
endowed with a higher spiritual life in the following birth, and so on
until they attain final emancipation.</p>
<p>After attaining <i>moksha</i> or salvation the soul becomes free
from the wheel of birth and rebirth.</p>
<p>To the souls of the sinful, who leave their bodies with a great
struggle, the messengers of the god of death present themselves in a
terrible form. They are carried to hell by the southern gate, being
constantly lashed on the way. There they are relegated to one of the
twenty-eight pits (of hell) appropriate to their misdeeds, to suffer
retribution for their sins.<a class="noteref" id="n123.2src" href=
"#n123.2" name="n123.2src">62</a></p>
<p>The soul is carried to Dharmar&#257;ja after it leaves the body.
Thence, with the permission of the god, it returns to this world and
halts for thirteen days at the threshold of its house. On the
thirteenth day an earthen jar filled with water is emptied on a
<i>pipal</i> tree (<span lang="la">Ficus religiosa</span>) after which
its connection with this world ceases. Then it returns to the heavenly
judge of actions (Dharmar&#257;ja), and is again born in the species
prescribed by him. The soul of a strictly spiritual being merges into
the divine entity and becomes free from birth and rebirth.</p>
<p><i>Moksha</i> or <i>Mukti</i>, that is final emancipation is of two
kinds, <i>s&#257;yujya</i> or merging into the divine form and
<i>s&#257;mishya</i> or entering the divine order and living in this
state so long as one&rsquo;s merits allow.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n123.2">62</a></p>
<p>Dharmar&#257;ja keeps an account of the good and bad actions of all
men in his book <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e12660" href=
"#xd26e12660" name="xd26e12660">124</a>]</span>called <i>siddhi
karan</i>, and dispenses justice according to it. A man guilty of
adultery is sentenced to embrace a redhot image of a woman; one who has
slaughtered animals is devoured by those animals; while those who have
committed the sin of murdering Br&#257;hmans are relegated to hell for
ever.<a class="noteref" id="n124.1src" href="#n124.1" name=

<p>There are seven rungs to the ladder which leads to the next world.
The first is covered with a thick forest. The second bristles with
pointed spears. The third is strewn with <i>gokharu</i> (a species of
thorns). The fourth has piercing blasts. On the fifth runs the river
Vaitarna. The sixth is full of red-hot iron. The seventh is covered
with deep streams.<a class="noteref" id="n124.2src" href="#n124.2"
name="n124.2src">64</a></p>
<p>After death, the soul has to cross the river Vaitarna (<i>vide</i>
the fifth rung above) on its way to the next world. Those who have
given cows in charity can cross this river without difficulty by
holding the tails of the cows, who present themselves to help them.</p>
<p>Those who have given shoes in charity can tread the third step with
ease.</p>
<p>The sinful have to walk barefooted on ground studded with pointed
spears, and to embrace red-hot iron pillars. It is with the object of
avoiding these miseries that people distribute shoes and clothes in
charity.<a class="noteref" id="n124.3src" href="#n124.3" name=
"n124.3src">65</a></p>
<p>The sinful expiate their sins by passing through a cycle of
8,400,000 <span class="corr" id="xd26e12691" title=

the species of worms produced from sweat, 2,100,000 times from
embryonic birth and a similar number of times in the vegetable
kingdom.</p>
<p>Those who lack virtue but commit no sins are born in the divine
order of a low grade such as the servants of Kuber, the attendants of
the god Shiva, Gandharvas, Vait&#257;ls, Brahmar&#257;kshasas,
Kushm&#257;nds and other demigods. Virtuous women are born as goddesses
or <i>devis</i> or as <i>apsar&#257;s</i> or celestial songstresses.
Those who have performed only a few acts of righteousness enter the
ranks of Jakhanis, Kinnaris, M&#257;trik&#257;s, and the maid servants
of the goddess Durga.<a class="noteref" id="n124.4src" href="#n124.4"
name="n124.4src">67</a></p>
<p>The souls of the righteous are carried by <i>Yamadutas</i> or the
messengers of the god of death through five cities, by a route passing
through beautiful gardens; while those of the sinful are led barefooted
over brambles and pointed spears by roads running through dense forests
hidden in pitchy darkness. The latter have also to cross large rivers
and pass through streams filled with blood and puss. As they pass,
eagles prey upon their bodies and they are bitten by venomous
snakes.<a class="noteref" id="n124.5src" href="#n124.5" name=
"n124.5src">68</a></p>
<p>The souls of those who have in life performed good actions pass
through the sun and assume divine forms; while those of ordinary beings
pass through the moon and return to this world.<a class="noteref" id=
"n124.6src" href="#n124.6" name="n124.6src">69</a></p>
<p>A sinful soul has to go to <i>Yamaloka</i> or hell through sixteen
cities. On its way it has to cross the river Vaitarna, which consists
of blood mixed with puss. He who has presented a cow to a Br&#257;hman
can cross this river with ease. Beyond this river lies a land which is
covered with spikes. Those who have given in charity
<i>ashtamah&#257;d&#257;n</i>, that is, sesamum seeds, flour, gold,
cotton, salt, clarified butter, milk and sugarcandy, can walk over this
ground without being hurt. When the soul has reached Yama or the god of
death, the sun and the moon, the ever-living witnesses of human
actions, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e12735" href="#xd26e12735"

<p>In order that the departed soul may not find its way difficult, his
heirs make a gift to a Br&#257;hman of a bedstead, bedding, a lamp,
corn, a pair of shoes and other articles, on the thirteenth day after
death. This gift is called <i>seraja</i>.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>One enters the human order after passing through 8,400,000 species
of living beings. It is in the human life that one can accumulate
merit, and wipe out the influence of past sins.</p>
<p>Those who meet a sudden or violent death, e. g., by being crushed
under a falling house, by drowning in a well, by an accidental fall, by
a snake bite, etc. enter the order of <i>bhuts</i>, <i>pretas</i>,
<i>pish&#257;chas</i>, etc., and are said to have gone to durgati or to
a bad path.<a class="noteref" id="n125.3src" href="#n125.3" name=

lives.<a class="noteref" id="n125.5src" href="#n125.5" name=
"n125.5src">74</a></p>
<p>Their souls are said to be liable to enter the <i>asurgati</i> or
the order of devils. They are emancipated from this condition by the
performance by their descendants of the ceremony called <i>Nil

<p>In the case of suicides, when the crime is proved before the god of
death the culprit is hurled into a hell called <i>Mah&#257;raurava</i>,
where he has to pass a thousand years. After the expiry of this period
he is born again into this world, again commits suicide, and again
meets the same fate after death. This is repeated seven times, after
which he has to pass through 8,400,000 species of animals before again
obtaining the human life.<a class="noteref" id="n125.8src" href=

<p>Some believe that the souls of persons meeting a violent death enter
the order of such ghosts as <i>Jinni</i>, <i>M&#257;mo</i>, etc. For
their emancipation <i>shr&#257;ddhas</i> are performed by their
descendants. At times these ghosts possess the persons of their nearest
relatives, and through this medium declare their desires. If they
express a desire to have a <i>p&#257;lio</i> or pillar erected in their
name, one is erected on the spot where they breathed their last. On
this pillar is engraved a figure riding a horse, representing the
deceased, which is besmeared with red lead or ochre. This
representation is worshipped as a deity with offerings of frankincense,
cocoanuts and lamps fed with <i>ghi</i>.<a class="noteref" id=

"n126.asrc" href="#n126.a" name="n126.asrc">91</a> and to offer a
victim and frankincense to the evil spirit, which is supposed to drive
the spirit out by the same route by which it entered the body.<a class=

<p>Another method of driving away an evil spirit from the body is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>As soon as it is ascertained that a man is possessed by an evil
spirit, somebody catches hold of the top-knot of the man or ties it
into a knot. Next he is lashed with a whip or chain until the ghost in
him cries out &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t beat me. I shall leave the body
and shall never return.&rdquo; Then the ghost is told that it is a
liar, that it said a thousand times that it would leave the body and
not return, but it did not do it. No faith, therefore, would be put in
its word. After a haggling dialogue of this kind and on the
ghost&rsquo;s confirmation of its offer never to return by some
satisfactory oath or assurance, the top-knot is unloosed and the ghost
disappears.<a class="noteref" id="n126.10src" href="#n126.10" name=
"n126.10src">94</a></p>
<p>A third method is to subject the person possessed to the fumes of
red chillies or of black wood, or to tie a sacred thread round his
elbow.</p>
<p>After one of these <span class="corr" id="xd26e12935" title=
"Source: processess">processes</span> has been performed to expel the
ghost, the victim gives a deep yawn, and it is said that the ghost goes
out in the yawn. Next the relieved person is given water to drink, and
an exorcist is engaged to take measures to prevent the possibility of
the ghost&rsquo;s return.<a class="noteref" id="n126.11src" href=

<p>In a book entitled <i>Br&#257;hman Nighanta Ratn&#257;kar</i> is
described the method of driving away an evil spirit from the body of a
man by an offering of <i>dhup</i> or frankincense. The <i>dhup</i> to
be used for this purpose must be made of <i>gugal</i>, and it must be
offered with honey and clarified butter, repeating the following
<i>mantra</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen. Bow to the divine Lord of the evil spirits, the Lord
whose teeth, jaws, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e12961" href=

irresistible anger, who holds a crescent moon on the forehead and
matted hair on the head, whose body is besmeared with ashes; whose neck
is adorned by the poison of the fierce lord of the cobras. Oh! may
success attend to thee! Oh! Great one! The Lord of spirits! manifest
thy form, dance, dance; move, move; tie with a chain, tie; terrify by a

<p>There are various superstitious beliefs entertained by people
regarding sneezing.</p>
<p>According to one belief, if a person sneezes face to face with
another who is about to begin an auspicious act, such as starting on a
journey, decking his person with ornaments, performing a marriage
ceremony, and the like, it portends misfortune to the latter; but a
sneeze on his right or at his back foretells good. A sneeze in front of
a person starting to perform an auspicious act is supposed to mean that
a blow has been struck on his forehead, suggesting that the act should
be stopped. If, in spite of this warning, the act is commenced, evil
consequences are sure to follow.</p>
<p>A sneeze at a man&rsquo;s back confirms the unobstructed fulfilment
of the act taken in hand, as it is believed to have patted the man on
his back or shoulders in token of approval.</p>
<p>Sneezes on either side, right or left, portend neither good nor
evil.</p>
<p>As a rule, sneezes are believed to forebode evil, and it is
considered highly unmannerly to sneeze while one is about to begin an
auspicious act or start with a good purpose. If, in spite of this
etiquette, one sneezes, he excuses himself by saying that he is
suffering from cold.<a class="noteref" id="n127.2src" href="#n127.2"
name="n127.2src">97</a></p>
<p>Some people believe that a sneeze in front is an indication of a
broil on the road, a sneeze on the left side portends loss of money,
one from above is a harbinger of success, one from below foretells
danger, while the sneeze of the man who is engaged or is starting on
the act contemplated is believed to be very injurious. A sneeze on the
right is considered neither good nor bad.<a class="noteref" id=
"n127.3src" href="#n127.3" name="n127.3src">98</a></p>
<p>A sneeze in the east causes anxiety, in the south-east foretells
happiness, in the south speaks of coming loss, and in the south-west is
an indication of good. A sneeze from the west or north-west is
considered good, from the north injurious, and from the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e12989" title="Source: east">north-east</span>
auspicious.<a class="noteref" id="n127.4src" href="#n127.4" name=
"n127.4src">99</a></p>
<p>Some lines from the sayings of Gorakhr&#257;j run to the effect that
a sneeze in the east causes anxiety, one in the south-east inflicts a
sound beating, one in the south brings a visitor or guest, one in the
south-west subjects the person concerned to a taunt, one in the west
bestows a throne or crown, one in the north-west promises sweets or
dainties, one in the north foretells good, one in the north-east brings
disappointment, while one&rsquo;s own sneeze is so ominous that one
should never start out on any business after sneezing.<a class=
"noteref" id="n127.5src" href="#n127.5" name="n127.5src">100</a></p>
<p>The beliefs enumerated above relate to sneezes which occur on
certain week days. The sneezes which occur on Sundays have the
following consequences.</p>
<p>A sneeze from the east is good, one from the south-east points to
delay in the fulfilment of one&rsquo;s intended object, one from the
south brings in profit, one from the south-west results in death, one
from the west in happiness, one from the north-west throws one into the
society of good men, one from the north is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e13005" href="#xd26e13005" name=
"xd26e13005">128</a>]</span>productive of pecuniary gain, and one from
the north-east of general wellbeing.<a class="noteref" id="n128.1src"
href="#n128.1" name="n128.1src">101</a></p>
<p>It is a common belief that if while one is about to commence some
act, somebody sneezes once, the act is doomed to fail, and to avoid
failure it must be postponed. But if the sneeze is repeated, no harm
ensues.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n128.1">101</a></p>
<p>A sneeze by an ailing person is believed to be a sign of his
recovery, and more sneezes by the same person are supposed to indicate
his complete recovery, even though the symptoms be not favourable.</p>
<p>A sneeze by a cow at the commencement of an auspicious act is
supposed to be the worst possible omen, and a sneeze by a cat is
proverbially a portent of failure in any act taken in hand at the
time.<a class="noteref" id="n128.2src" href="#n128.2" name=
"n128.2src">102</a></p>
<p>A yawn is generally believed to be harmless, as it does not foretell
either good or evil. Still as sometimes it results in accidental
instantaneous death, the elders of a person when he yawns, exclaim,
&ldquo;Be long-lived! Patience! Live long!&rdquo;, and the spiritually
disposed repeat the name of the god of their devotion.<a class=
"noteref" id="n128.3src" href="#n128.3" name="n128.3src">103</a></p>
<p>Lest spirits may make their way into the body of a person through
his mouth when he is yawning, or lest his soul may pass out of it, some
people pinch him to stop the yawn while others utter the words
&ldquo;R&#257;m&rdquo; &ldquo;R&#257;m&rdquo; to divert his
attention.<a class="noteref" id="n128.4src" href="#n128.4" name=

<p>In mythological times, Brahma, one of the gods of the Hindu Trinity,
once left his body for a time. Some people began to molest the body,
when he cried out, &ldquo;<i>R&#257;kho! R&#257;kho!</i>&rdquo; that is
&ldquo;Keep aloof! Keep aloof!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wait! Wait!&rdquo;.
These people came to be called <i>R&#257;kho</i><a class="noteref" id=

<p>Most high caste people, on the death of their first wives, take an

and cause their second wives to wear them round their necks.<a class=

impresses of feet are called <i>shok-pagal&#257;ns</i> or mourning
footprints. Among the lower castes, the hands or the feet of the second

<p>It is also believed that any male member of a family dying with

<p>The spirits of men that fall victims to tigers or other wild animals

their descendants on the fourteenth day of the dark half of

<p>It is believed that a woman dying in child-bed or menses enters the
order of ghosts variously known as <i>Chudels</i>, <i>Vantris</i> or
<i>Taxamis</i>. In order that she may not return from the cremation
ground, mustard seeds are strewn along the road behind her bier, for a
belief prevails that she can only succeed in returning if she can
collect all the mustard seeds thus strewn on the way.<a class="noteref"

<p>In some places, loose cotton wool is thrown over the bier so as to
be scattered all along the road to the cemetery. It is believed that
the <i>Chudel</i> can only return to the house if she can collect all
the cotton scattered behind her in one night. This is considered an
impossible task, and no fear is therefore entertained of her return
after the cotton has been scattered.<a class="noteref" id="n131.11src"
href="#n131.11" name="n131.11src">150</a></p>
<p>To prevent the return of the <i>Chudel</i>, some people pass
underneath the bier the legs of the cot on which the woman lay in her
confinement, while others drive in an iron nail at the end of the
street immediately after the corpse has been carried beyond the village
boundary.<a class="noteref" id="n131.12src" href="#n131.12" name=

<p>Even after the precautions mentioned above have been taken, to
prevent the return of a <i>Chudel</i> or <i>Vantri</i>,
<i>Shr&#257;ddhas</i> are performed, and a number of Br&#257;hman women
feasted on the twelfth and thirteenth day after death to propitiate her

<p>There is no belief that the father has to take special precautions
at the birth of his child except that care is taken to note the exact
time of the child&rsquo;s birth for the purpose of casting its
horoscope correctly. An inkstand and pen are also placed in the

<p>All children born in <i>Jyeshta Nakshatra</i>,
<i>Mula-nakshatra</i>, or <i>Yamaghanta</i> are said to cause the death
of their male parent. Such children were left to starve uncared for in
forests in olden times; but now-a-days they are kept alive, as certain
performances are believed to avert the evil. One such performance is
only to see the child after clarified butter has been given in
donation. Another is to see its face after it has been bathed with the
water collected from eighteen wells in a pot with a thousand
holes.<a class="noteref" id="n132.4src" href="#n132.4" name=

<p>If the birth time of a child happens to fall within the ecliptic

<p>One of the beliefs entertained by Hindus about the owl is that none
should throw a lump of earth at it, as the owl is believed to pick up
the missile and throw it into a well or tank or any sheet of water,
with the result that it gradually dissolves and disappears, and
simultaneously the body of the person is said to be consumed.<a class=

<p>If perchance an owl utters some note perching on the top cross beam
of a house on a Sunday or Tuesday night, the owner of the house should
pass a dark woollen thread below the cross beam, to which a nude person
should give a knot at every screech of the owl. If such a thread be
kept in one&rsquo;s anklet, one need have no fear of ghosts nor can he
be seen by a <i>d&#257;kan</i> or witch.</p>
<p>If a person in sleep responds to the call of an owl, he is believed
to expire within six months from that date.<a class="noteref" id=

<h2 class="main">THE EVIL EYE AND THE SCARING OF GHOSTS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The superstitious dread of an evil eye is to be seen
mostly among ignorant people, especially among women. If a boy were to
fall ill, they say, &ldquo;Chhotio (the name of the boy) was playing in
the house wearing a fine dress and was prattling sweetly, when that
wretch came to the house and her evil eye fell on him&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="n134.1src" href="#n134.1" name="n134.1src">1</a> or
&ldquo;The boy was eating a dainty dish when that devilish woman came
up and her evil eye influenced the boy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"n134.2src" href="#n134.2" name="n134.2src">2</a></p>
<p>Persons born on a Sunday or Tuesday are generally believed to have
an evil eye.<a class="noteref" id="n134.3src" href="#n134.3" name=
"n134.3src">3</a></p>
<p>The evil eye causes its victim to vomit what he has eaten in its
presence.<a class="noteref" id="n134.4src" href="#n134.4" name=
"n134.4src">4</a></p>
<p>If a child weeps all day long, or a person finds his appetite very
weak, the evil is attributed to an evil eye.<a class="noteref" id=
"n134.5src" href="#n134.5" name="n134.5src">5</a></p>
<p>If milch cattle do not give milk, or if <i>seva</i>
(vermicelli)<span class="corr" id="xd26e13942" title=

"corr" id="xd26e13948" title="Not in source">,</span> pickles,
<i>dudhp&#257;k</i> (rice cooked in milk and sweetened with sugar) or
such other eatables are spoilt, it is believed that the evil eye is at
the root of the trouble.<a class="noteref" id="n134.6src" href=
"#n134.6" name="n134.6src">6</a></p>
<p>It is believed that the following objects are liable to be
influenced by an evil eye:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Persons having fine glossy hair, fiery eyes, exquisite form,
refined gait, fine speech or good handwriting, (2) good sportsmen, (3),
pickles, (4) <i>p&#257;pad</i> (wafer biscuits), (5) <i><span class=

(vermicelli), (6) all attractive objects<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e13969" title="Not in source">.</span></p>
<p>If a person falls ill after he is praised, he is said to have been a
victim of an evil eye.<a class="noteref" id="n134.7src" href="#n134.7"
name="n134.7src">7</a></p>
<p>The precautions taken to evade the influence of the evil eye are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) When children are dressed and decked with ornaments, a spot is
made on their cheeks or near their necks with a black pigment or
collyrium, as it is believed that the dark colour is an antidote
against the influence of the evil eye.</p>
<p>(2) Some efficacious inscription is engraved on a copper plate,
which is suspended round the child&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>(3) A bead of <i>kachakada</i> is also worn round the neck.</p>
<p>(4) A tiger&rsquo;s nail or tooth is worn round the neck.</p>
<p>(5) An iron ring is worn on the finger.</p>
<p>(6) A lime is worn in the turban or headdress.</p>
<p>(7) An incantation in the praise of Hanum&#257;n is written on a
piece of paper and put in an anklet which is worn.</p>
<p>(8) A piece of thread of five kinds of silk or cotton spun by a
virgin is given seven knots on the fourteenth day of the dark half of
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e14000" title=
"Source: &Aacute;shvin">&#256;shvin</span></i> and worn on the
person.</p>
<p>(9) In order that sweet meats and other eatables such as
<i>p&#257;pad</i> (wafer biscuits), pickles, etc., may not be spoilt by
an evil eye, a lime, an iron nail or a knife is put into them.</p>
<p>(10) In order that a cot or cradle may not be broken by the
influence of an evil eye, a black woollen thread is tied round it.</p>
<p>(11) To prevent <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e14013" title=
"Source: dudhb&#257;k">dudhp&#257;k</span></i> (rice cooked in milk and
sweetened with sugar) from being spoilt, a piece of charcoal is put
into the pot in which it is prepared.<a class="noteref" id="n134.8src"
href="#n134.8" name="n134.8src">8</a></p>
<p>While taking one&rsquo;s meal one should avoid the company of an
evil-eyed person, but if perchance one <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e14022" title="Source: happen">happens</span> to be present, a
morsel of the food should be thrown behind him or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e14025" href="#xd26e14025" name=
"xd26e14025">135</a>]</span>set aside on the ground as an offering to
the evil eye.<a class="noteref" id="n135.1src" href="#n135.1" name=
"n135.1src">9</a></p>
<p>If, in spite of the precautions mentioned above, the influence of
the evil eye prevails, the following remedies are adopted to remove its
effects:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The evil eye is fastened or curbed, as they say, by one of the
processes described in Chapter III above.</p>
<p>(2) A red-hot charcoal is placed on a dinner plate and covered with
an earthen jar. A bowl filled with water is then passed round the head
of the patient, emptied over the jar and placed on it with its mouth
touching the jar. Next, a scythe is placed over the bowl. The jar,
which is heated with the heat of the burning charcoal placed under it
produces a hissing sound as soon as it is touched by the water in the
bowl, and is said to speak. This process is called <i>Ghadulo</i> and
is performed after sunset.<a class="noteref" id="n135.2src" href=
"#n135.2" name="n135.2src">10</a></p>
<p>In some places, it is a belief that the plate to be used in this
process must be of bell-metal, and that over the fire placed in it
mustard seeds, chillies and salt must be thrown before it is covered
with the earthen jar.<a class="noteref" id="n135.3src" href="#n135.3"
name="n135.3src">11</a></p>
<p>(3) An <i>ut&#257;r</i><a class="noteref" id="n135.asrc" href=
"#n135.a" name="n135.asrc">12</a> or sacrificial offering is taken to
the village gate on a Sunday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>(4) Milk is passed three or seven times round the head of the ailing
child, poured into a black earthen pot, and offered to a black bitch on
a Sunday or Tuesday.<a class="noteref" id="n135.4src" href="#n135.4"
name="n135.4src">13</a></p>
<p>(5) The mother or some other near relative of the child suffering
from the effects of the evil eye, puts in a bell-metal cup mustard
seed, salt, chillies and seven stones from the village gate, passes the
cup thrice round the child&rsquo;s head, puts burning charcoal in the
cup, and after it is heated, places it overturned in a bell-metal pot
and pours over it water mixed with cowdung, so that the cup adheres to
the pot. This sticking of the cup is called <i lang="gu-latn">najar
chonti gai</i> (the evil eye has stuck fast) and is believed to cure
the child.<a class="noteref" id="n135.5src" href="#n135.5" name=
"n135.5src">14</a></p>
<p>(6) An exorcist is engaged to wave a bowl filled with water round
the head of the patient. He then drinks off the water, and the patient
believes that the disease has been drunk with it.<a class="noteref" id=
"n135.6src" href="#n135.6" name="n135.6src">15</a></p>
<p>(7) A handful of salt and chillies is passed thrice round the head
of the patient and thrown into the fire. If the chillies burn without
giving out fumes of an unpleasant odour, the evil eye is believed to be
at the root of the illness.<a class="noteref" id="n135.bsrc" href=
"#n135.b" name="n135.bsrc">16</a><a class="noteref" id="n135.7src"
href="#n135.7" name="n135.7src">17</a></p>
<p>(8) A little dust collected from a spot where two roads cross one
another, or red lead and oil offered to Hanum&#257;n, a red chilly, an
iron nail and grains of <i>adad</i> (Phaseolus mungo) are packed into a
piece of white cotton cloth with a black woollen thread, and tied to
the cradle of the suffering child.<a class="noteref" id="n135.8src"
href="#n135.8" name="n135.8src">18</a></p>
<p>(9) A side of a loaf of millet flour is baked by being exposed to
fire, clarified butter is applied to this side, and a fine cotton
thread is passed round the loaf. Next, the loaf is waved round the head
of the ailing child and thrown into fire. If the cotton thread is not
burnt by the fire, an evil eye is believed to be the cause of the
illness.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n135.8">18</a></p>
<p>Sometimes the loaf is offered to a black dog after it has been waved
round the child&rsquo;s head.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n135.8">18</a></p>
<p>(10) If the illness be due to the influence of the evil eye of a
woman, she is called in and asked to pass her hand over the
child&rsquo;s head.<a class="noteref" id="n135.9src" href="#n135.9"
name="n135.9src">19</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e14105" href=
"#xd26e14105" name="xd26e14105">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>(11) In order to avoid the effects of the evil eye, when a child
returns home from an outside visit, a bowl filled with water is passed
thrice round its head and emptied outside the house before it crosses
the threshold of the house.<a class="noteref" id="n136.1src" href=
"#n136.1" name="n136.1src">20</a></p>
<p>(12) The grains of <i>Adad</i>, twigs of the <i>Thor</i> (Euphoria
nerifolia), salt and dust are passed seven times round the head of a
person suffering from the effects of an evil eye, on the threshold of
the house, and thrown away.<a class="noteref" id="n136.2src" href=
"#n136.2" name="n136.2src">21</a></p>
<p>(13) Grains of <i>Adad</i>, twigs of the <i>Thor</i>, salt, an iron
nail and charcoal are put into an unused earthen pot and taken to the
village boundary with a bowl filled with water. The person carrying the
pot and bowl should not look behind either on his way to, or on his
return from, the village boundary. The pot is placed on the village
boundary, and water is poured over it seven times from the
bowl.<a class="noteref" id="n136.3src" href="#n136.3" name=
"n136.3src">22</a></p>
<p>(14) A loaf baked on one side, with seven grains of <i>Adad</i>,
seven grains of salt and seven cotton seeds placed over it, is passed
seven times round the patient&rsquo;s head and placed on a spot where
two roads cross one another. The person carrying the bread should not
look behind while carrying it.<a class="noteref" id="n136.4src" href=
"#n136.4" name="n136.4src">23</a></p>
<p>Those whose children do not live, or die in infancy, or who get
children with difficulty, give them opprobrious names, as it is
believed that objects so named, being considered of no value, are left
unharmed both by men and by gods.<a class="noteref" id="n136.5src"
href="#n136.5" name="n136.5src">24</a></p>
<p>Some people believe that children so named are considered impure by
Fate or Destiny, and consequently not molested by her.<a class=
"noteref" id="n136.6src" href="#n136.6" name="n136.6src">25</a></p>
<p>It is believed by some that, as good names attract attention, giving
opprobrious names averts the danger of the evil eye.<a class="noteref"
id="n136.7src" href="#n136.7" name="n136.7src">26</a></p>
<p>Some people throw a newly-born child on a dung-hill and take it
back, saying that they found it on the dung-hill, with the belief that
a child of such low origin cannot be snatched away from them by Fate.
Such children are named Punjio, Unkardo or Kacharo meaning
&lsquo;dung-hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some children are named Khoto, Amatho or Jutho, all meaning
&lsquo;false&rsquo;, with the belief that children so named are
considered to belong to gods or Fate, and hence cannot be taken away
from their parents by the god of death.</p>
<p>Some people exchange their children for sweets, or offer them to
others and purchase them back at a nominal price. Others roll them in
the dust and name them Dhulio or dust. This is believed to ensure a
long life to the children.<a class="noteref" id="n136.8src" href=
"#n136.8" name="n136.8src">27</a></p>
<p>In some places, a relative of the child&rsquo;s on the
mother&rsquo;s side presents it with a necklace of gold beads shaped
like large black ants. When the child attains the age of eight or ten
years this necklace is offered to some god or goddess. The child is
named S&#257;nkalio as it wears round its neck this <i>s&#257;nkal</i>
or chain, that is, necklace.<a class="noteref" id="n136.9src" href=
"#n136.9" name="n136.9src">28</a></p>
<p>It is held by some that children bearing contemptuous names are not
affected by magic.<a class="noteref" id="n136.10src" href="#n136.10"
name="n136.10src">29</a></p>
<p>Some weigh the child against corn and give the name of that corn to
the child, <i>e. g.</i>, &lsquo;Kodario&rsquo;<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e14184" title="Source: .">,</span> &lsquo;Juv&#257;rio&rsquo;. The
corn is then distributed among beggars, which is supposed to ensure a
long life to the child.<a class="noteref" id="n136.11src" href=
"#n136.11" name="n136.11src">30</a></p>
<p>Some make earthen figures of children, call them <i>Ila Ili</i> or
<i>Pithad</i>, and carry them through the village on the <i>Holi</i>
day (the full-moon day of <i>F&#257;lgun</i>), with the belief that by
so doing they ensure a long life to the children. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e14204" href="#xd26e14204" name=
"xd26e14204">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is related that a carpenter&rsquo;s children used to die in
infancy, so he named one of his sons &lsquo;Pithad&rsquo; and he lived.
Since then, parents whose children do not live name them
&lsquo;Pithad<span class="corr" id="xd26e14207" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span>. Some name their children
&lsquo;Jivo&rsquo; that is &lsquo;Live&rsquo; with the hope that they
may live long.<a class="noteref" id="n137.1src" href="#n137.1" name=

<p>It is said that in ancient times change of sex could be
effected.</p>
<p>Tradition relates that all the children of a certain Solanki king
died in infancy, except the last child, a girl. She was dressed in male
attire and passed for a boy. When the pretended boy attained
marriageable age, he was betrothed to a princess. When the day fixed
for the marriage drew near, the king became anxious and went on an
hunting expedition to pass the time. On his way back from the hunt he
became very thirsty, and quenched his thirst with the water of a pond
near which a temple of Bahuchar&#257;ji stands to this day. His bitch,
which was with him, leapt into the pond, and on coming out of the water
was found to be transformed into a dog. On seeing this the king brought
his daughter and bathed her into the pond with the result that she was
transformed into a boy. The king then built a big tank on the spot,
which is known by the name of <i>M&#257;n</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"n138.7src" href="#n138.7" name="n138.7src">43</a></p>
<p>In a chapter called <i>Brahmottar Khand</i> of the <i>Padma
Pur&#257;n</i>, which describes the glory of a vow called <i>Uma
Mahesh</i>, the greatness of observing fasts on Mondays is described at
length. Two Br&#257;hman brothers, one dressed as a man and the other
as a woman, set out on a journey. Once they halted in a temple of the
god Shiva, where lived a woman who had observed the fasts on Mondays.
She invited them to dinner, taking them, as they appeared to be, for a
man and a woman. The devotion of the hostess was so great that the
brother dressed as a woman was actually transformed into a woman while
partaking of the meal served to him.<a class="noteref" id="n138.8src"
href="#n138.8" name="n138.8src">44</a></p>
<p>It is related that in ancient times the son of a certain sage once
disguised himself as a girl with the result that he was actually
changed into a girl. He was thereafter called Mudr&#257;lopi and
married to the sage Agastya.<a class="noteref" id="n138.9src" href=
"#n138.9" name="n138.9src">45</a></p>
<p>The warrior Shikhandi who assisted the P&#257;ndavas in killing
Bhishma (who had vowed not to raise his arms against a woman) was at
first a girl, and was subsequently transformed into a boy by the boon
of the gods.<a class="noteref" id="n138.10src" href="#n138.10" name=

<p>There is supposed to be a forest of P&#257;rvati in a continent
called Ilavrit. Any man visiting it is at once turned into a
woman.<a class="noteref" id="n138.11src" href="#n138.11" name=
"n138.11src">47</a></p>
<p>A king named Sudyaman visited this forest and was transformed into a

<p>Amulets are generally used as a precaution against the attack of
evil spirits or the influence of an evil eye. They are also used to
cure diseases. They are made of iron, copper, tin, gold, silver, alloys
of precious metals, or leather.</p>
<p><i>Chithis</i> or pieces of paper on which mystic signs are drawn
are put into the amulets and are tied to the forearm with black woollen
or silk thread.<a class="noteref" id="n139.9src" href="#n139.9" name=
"n139.9src">59</a></p>
<p>In some places, frankincense of <i>gugal</i> (<span lang=

worn.<a class="noteref" id="n139.10src" href="#n139.10" name=
"n139.10src">60</a></p>
<p>Amulets are also made of <i>t&#257;d-patras</i> (palm-leaves). They
are tied round the arm with an indigo-coloured cloth.<a class="noteref"
id="n139.11src" href="#n139.11" name="n139.11src">61</a></p>
<p><i>Dor&#257;s</i> or threads are also worn with the same object as
amulets. They are generally made of five kinds of silk thread, black
wool, or red or black cotton thread. The length of the <i>dora</i> must
be eight feet, one and a quarter of a cubit or a man&rsquo;s height.
They must have three folds and must be twisted seven or twenty-one
times. After they are twisted, they are knotted seven, fourteen or
twenty-one times, when they become ready for use. An offering of
frankincense made of <i>gugal</i> or of <i>lob&#257;n</i> is made to a
<i>dora</i> before it is worn.<a class="noteref" id="n139.12src" href=
"#n139.12" name="n139.12src">62</a></p>
<p>It is believed by some people, that a <i>chiti</i> (amulet) or
<i>dora</i> in order to be effective, must not be touched with
water.</p>
<p>The <i>dora</i> of the god <span class="corr" id="xd26e14834" title=
"Source: K&#257;lbhairav">K&#257;l-bhairav</span> at Benares, which is
made of silk thread with seven twists, is tied round the wrist of a
patient in the belief that it cures illness.</p>
<p>A <i>janjiro</i> (black cotton thread with seven knots) of the god
Hanum&#257;n is worn round the arm with the same belief.</p>
<p><i>Surakano</i>, that is, twisted iron wire, consecrated by the
worshipper of the goddess Machhu, is worn by the Bharv&#257;ds round
the elbow or the wrist with the belief that it cures wind.</p>
<p>Those people whose children do not live long put silver anklets
round their left legs in the belief that by so doing their life is
lengthened.<a class="noteref" id="n139.13src" href="#n139.13" name=

<p>An amulet made of a piece of cloth is called
<i>dh&#257;ga</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n140.1src" href="#n140.1"
name="n140.1src">64</a> It is either a piece of cloth used by a holy
man, a piece of cloth containing a mixture of red lead and oil offered
to the god Hanum&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id="n140.2src" href=
"#n140.2" name="n140.2src">65</a> or a piece of cloth in which are

either worn round the wrist or suspended from the neck.<a class=

<p>Amulets tied to the horns of pet animals such as cows, bullocks,
horses, etc., are called <i>d&#257;man&#257;s</i>. Sometimes they are
also suspended from the necks of these animals. They are made of the
hides of sacred animals and are believed to protect the animals against
the evil eye, evil spirits and magic.<a class="noteref" id="n140.4src"
href="#n140.4" name="n140.4src">67</a></p>
<p>It is believed by some people that one can escape injury from an
evil spirit by seating oneself in a circle or square drawn in and
plastered with cowdung.<a class="noteref" id="n140.5src" href="#n140.5"
name="n140.5src">68</a></p>
<p>Others hold that the circle must be drawn with the point of a
sword.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n140.5">68</a></p>
<p>Some maintain that the circle cannot be a protective unless it is
drawn with enchanted water, milk or sesamum oil.</p>
<p>There are others who are of opinion that the entry of evil spirits
into the circle can be prevented only by calling upon God not to allow
the evil spirits to enter it.<a class="noteref" id="n140.6src" href=
"#n140.6" name="n140.6src">69</a></p>
<p>When an evil spirit is expelled from the body of a person, it is
buried underground, a circle of water is made round the spot and an
iron nail is driven into the ground, in order that it may be imprisoned
there.<a class="noteref" id="n140.7src" href="#n140.7" name=
"n140.7src">70</a></p>
<p>If anybody step into such a circle, the evil spirit confined therein
takes possession of him, and is thus freed.<a class="noteref" id=
"n140.8src" href="#n140.8" name="n140.8src">71</a></p>
<p>To prevent this, evil spirits are generally confined in secluded
spots.<a class="noteref" id="n140.9src" href="#n140.9" name=
"n140.9src">72</a></p>
<p>As the circle drawn by the point of a sword is a protection against
an evil spirit, those who go to the burning ground to propitiate or
subjugate evil spirits, seat themselves in such circles while reciting
<i>mantras</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n140.10src" href="#n140.10" name=
"n140.10src">73</a></p>
<p>After entering the circle, some people recite the name of
Hanum&#257;n, Chandi or Bhairav.<a class="noteref" id="n140.11src"
href="#n140.11" name="n140.11src">74</a></p>
<p>Some people, after seating themselves in the circle, make offerings
to the evil spirits, while reciting <i>mantras</i>, to propitiate them
more easily. The <i>K&#257;li chaudas</i> or the fourteenth day of the
dark half of <i>Ashvin</i> is considered a suitable day for
propitiating or subjugating evil spirits.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Some numbers are believed to be auspicious and some inauspicious.
There is a book on this subject, in which some good or evil is
attributed to each number. One who wants to know the result of the
undertaking in hand puts his finger on any number in the book, and the
expounder of the science, reading the passage bearing on the number,
explains how the undertaking will end.<a class="noteref" id="n142.7src"
href="#n142.7" name="n142.7src">99</a></p>
<p>The numbers, 12, 18, 56 and 58 are considered inauspicious.<a class=
"noteref" id="n142.8src" href="#n142.8" name="n142.8src">100</a></p>
<p>An odd number is generally believed to be inauspicious. It is for
this reason that newly-married girls are not sent to their
husbands&rsquo; house for the first time in any of the odd years of
their age. They are also not sent back to their parents&rsquo; house in
an odd year of their age for the same reason.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The numbers 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, and 21 are believed to be lucky

<p>A belief exists that if a company of three start on a mission, the
mission is sure to fail. This has given rise to the proverb
&ldquo;<i>Tran trikat ane maha vikat</i>&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;Three
persons going on an errand meet with great difficulties or
danger.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="n142.11src" href="#n142.11" name=
"n142.11src">103</a></p>
<p>A zero is believed to be inauspicious. In monetary transactions or
bargains, therefore, all numbers ending in a zero are avoided. If such
numbers are unavoidable, the sign of &frac14; is placed before them.
The number 12 is considered unlucky, to avoid which 11&frac12; is used
in its place.<a class="noteref" id="n142.12src" href="#n142.12" name=

<p>Some people believe that the numbers 1&frac14;, 5, 7, 21, 108 and
1,008 are lucky while 12 is unlucky.<a class="noteref" id="n142.13src"
href="#n142.13" name="n142.13src">105</a></p>
<p>It is a belief that in the sales of cattle and certain other things

seller and buyer.<a class="noteref" id="n142.14src" href="#n142.14"
name="n142.14src">106</a></p>
<p>It is for this reason that in subscribing to charitable funds people
write 401 instead of 400 and so on. But 1&frac14; is preferred to 1 in
valuing things. So in all purchases and sales 1&frac14; is added to the
actual price of a thing.<a class="noteref" id="n142.15src" href=
"#n142.15" name="n142.15src">107</a></p>
<p>The numbers 5 and 7 are believed to be auspicious, because on

(barley) is made to the deities. Next, water of the Ganges or the Jumna
is dropped into the mouth of the dying man and the name of R&#257;m is
whispered in his ear, as this is believed to turn his consciousness to
God and thus facilitate his way to the other world.</p>
<p>When a patient is convinced that his case is hopeless, he
distributes money or other valuable articles among Br&#257;hmans, as
this is believed to make his way to heaven easy.</p>
<p>When life is extinct, the corpse is placed on the cow-dunged floor
and then carried on a bier to the burning ground with the cries of
&ldquo;Shri R&#257;m&rdquo;, &ldquo;R&#257;m&rdquo;, &ldquo;<i>R&#257;m
n&#257;m satya hai</i>&rdquo;,<a class="noteref" id="n144.asrc" href=

In the fuel with which it is burnt is put <i>Tulsi</i> (sweet
basil)<span class="corr" id="xd26e15369" title="Not in source">,</span>
<i>Pipal</i> and sandal wood and cocoanuts. The bones and ashes are
collected and preserved, to be thrown into the D&#257;modar
<i>kund</i>, (pool of water) at <i>Gaya</i> or other holy waters. For
three days after death, holy water and milk is offered to the spirit of
the deceased. On the 10th, 11th and 12th day after death, on all the
days of every month in the first year corresponding to the day of
death, and on every anniversary of the death, <i>Shr&#257;ddha</i> is
performed. <i>Shr&#257;ddha</i> is also performed annually on the day
corresponding to the day of death in the dark half of the month of
<i>Bh&#257;drapad</i>.</p>
<p>The ceremonies mentioned above are believed to make the passage of
the soul to the other world easy. For his final emancipation a man must

<p>Is is related that a <i>m&#257;mo</i> lived on a <i>Khijado</i> tree
at the gate of the village Surel. He manifested himself, dressed in
white garments, for a period of nearly ten years. Once he frightened
several persons out of their senses. It is said that on his being
propitiated with an offering of wheaten bread at his abode (the
<i>Khijado</i> tree), these persons recovered their senses.<a class=

<p>There is a step-well near H&#257;mpar under the jurisdiction of
Dhr&#257;ngadhra which is the resort of a <i>bhut</i>. A Gir&#257;sia
and his wife arrived here one day at midnight. The Gir&#257;sia tied
his mare to a tree hard by, and went to the well to fetch water for the
mare. On his return he found there a number of mares like his own tied
to the trees. He therefore smelt their mouths to recognise which of
them was his own, but in the flurry caused by the appearance of so many
mares, his waist-cloth got entangled, and while mounting his mare he
fell down, which frightened him so much that he exclaimed &ldquo;I am
overtaken (by a ghost)&rdquo; and died.<a class="noteref" id=

woman has yet succeeded in reciting a <i>garabi</i> (song) in honour of

the tamarind tree opposite the <i>chok</i> (square) is averse to its
completion.</p>
<p>There is a house at Porbandar haunted by a ghost, in which none is
able to reside.<a class="noteref" id="n148.11src" href="#n148.11" name=

used for sacrificial purposes, can be haunted by evil spirits. Such
trees are the <i>Khijado</i>, the <i>B&#257;val</i>, the

<p>There are various ways of frightening crying children to silence,
one of which is to invoke evil spirits.</p>
<p>When a child continues to cry for a long time, the mother says,
&ldquo;keep quiet, <i>B&#257;ghada</i> has come.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh
<i>B&#257;u</i>, come and take away this child.&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>B&#257;bara</i>, come here. Don&rsquo;t come, my child is now
silent.&rdquo; &ldquo;May <i>B&#257;ghada</i> carry you away.&rdquo;
These exclamations are uttered in such a tone and with such gestures,
that generally the child is at once frightened into silence.<a class=

<p>A <i>B&#257;va</i> or <i>Bair&#257;gi</i>, a <i>Fakir</i>, a tiger,
a dog, a cat or a rat are all presented to the child as objects of
terror, and are called one after another to silence it.<a class=

<h2 class="main">TREE AND SERPENT WORSHIP.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Certain trees are considered holy, and they are
neither cut nor their wood used as fuel.</p>
<p>The <i>Pipal</i> is one of such trees. It is considered to be the
incarnation of a Br&#257;hman, and to cut it is considered to be as
great a sin as murdering a Br&#257;hman. It is believed that the family
of one who cuts it becomes extinct.<a class="noteref" id="n150.1src"
href="#n150.1" name="n150.1src">1</a></p>
<p>Some people believe that the spirits of the deceased do not get
water to drink in the next world. The water poured at the root of the
<i>Pipal</i> on the 13th, 14th and 15th day of the dark half of
<i>K&#257;rtik</i> and <i>Shr&#257;van</i> and on the 14th day of the
bright half of <i>Chaitra</i> is believed to reach these spirits and
quench their thirst.<a class="noteref" id="n150.2src" href="#n150.2"
name="n150.2src">2</a></p>
<p>Although to cut the <i>Pipal</i> is supposed to be a great sin, it
is believed that if a corpse is burnt with its wood, the soul of the
deceased attains salvation.<a class="noteref" id="n150.3src" href=
"#n150.3" name="n150.3src">3</a></p>
<p>The <i>Vad</i> or banyan tree is believed to be a representation of
the god Shiva.<a class="noteref" id="n150.4src" href="#n150.4" name=
"n150.4src">4</a> There is a proverb to the effect that one who cuts
this tree is punished with the extirpation of his family.<a class=
"noteref" id="n150.5src" href="#n150.5" name="n150.5src">5</a></p>
<p>According to another belief, the god Vishnu once slept on this
tree.<a class="noteref" id="n150.6src" href="#n150.6" name=
"n150.6src">6</a></p>
<p>The <i>Tulsi</i> or sweet basil is considered to represent Lakshmi,
the wife of Vishnu. It is also related that Krishna wanted to kill the
demon Jalandhar, but he could not be killed on account of the merit of
the chastity of his wife Vrinda. Krishna, therefore, assumed the form
of Jalandhar, violated the chastity of Vrinda, and was thus enabled to
kill the demon. Krishna next expressed a desire to marry Vrinda, when
she transformed herself into the <i>Tulsi</i> plant. It is considered
an act of great religious merit to wed Krishna with the <i>Tulsi</i>,
and this marriage is celebrated every year by all Hindus on the 11th
day of the bright half of <i>K&#257;rtik</i> otherwise called <i>Dev
Div&#257;li</i>.</p>
<p>It is considered a great sin to uproot this plant, though no sin
attaches to the plucking of its leaves during the day time. The leaves
of the <i>Tulsi</i> are considered holy and are offered to the image of
the god Vishnu and are required in all religious ceremonies.<a class=
"noteref" id="n150.7src" href="#n150.7" name="n150.7src">7</a></p>
<p>The <i>Khijado</i> or <i>Shami</i> tree is also held sacred. When
the P&#257;ndavas lost their kingdom in gambling with the Kauravas, the
latter promised the former that they would give them back their kingdom
if they lived in the forest for twelve years and unknown for one year.
After having completed their stay in the forest, the P&#257;ndavas
remained unknown for one year in the city of Vir&#257;t. During this
year they concealed their weapons on a <i>Khijado</i> tree. Before
taking these weapons, they worshipped the tree. Next took place the
great battle of Kurukshetra in which the P&#257;ndavas won a splendid
victory. This has given rise to the custom of worshipping the tree on
the tenth day of the bright half of <i>Ashvin</i> or the <i>Dasara</i>
day.<a class="noteref" id="n150.8src" href="#n150.8" name=
"n150.8src">8</a></p>
<p>It is a common belief that a tree haunted by ghosts should not be
cut. So the <i>Khijado</i> is not cut, because it is the favourite
residence of ghosts.<a class="noteref" id="n150.9src" href="#n150.9"
name="n150.9src">9</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e16234" href=
"#xd26e16234" name="xd26e16234">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>Kadamb</i> (<span lang="la">Anthocephalus cadumba</span>) is
considered sacred because it is believed that God Krishna rested under
this tree when he took cattle to graze.<a class="noteref" id=
"n151.1src" href="#n151.1" name="n151.1src">10</a></p>
<p>The <i>Limbdo</i> (Nim tree) is also considered sacred as it
represents the god Brahma.<a class="noteref" id="n151.2src" href=
"#n151.2" name="n151.2src">11</a> Some believe that it represents
Jagann&#257;thji.<a class="noteref" id="n151.3src" href="#n151.3" name=
"n151.3src">12</a></p>
<p>The <i>Rudr&#257;ksha</i> is believed to be a representation of the
god Shiva. It is therefore considered a sin to cut it. Garlands of
<i>Rudr&#257;ksha</i> beads are worn round the neck by the devotees of
Shiva.</p>
<p>The leaves of the <i>Bel</i> (<span lang="la">Aegle marmelos</span>)
are offered to the god Shiva as they are supposed to be liked by him.
It is also considered a sin to cut this tree.<a class="noteref" id=
"n151.4src" href="#n151.4" name="n151.4src">13</a></p>
<p>The <i>Karan</i> (<span lang="la"><span class="corr" id="xd26e16282"
title="Source: Mimuspos">Mimusops</span> hexandra</span>) is believed
to be a representation of Shiva. A grove of the <i>Karan</i> trees is
supposed to be inhabited by natural powers called
<i>M&#257;t&#257;s</i> and to cut a <i>Karan</i> is supposed to bring
disaster to the cutter.<a class="noteref" id="n151.5src" href="#n151.5"
name="n151.5src">14</a></p>
<p>The <i>Maravo</i> (Marjoram) is considered sacred by Musalm&#257;ns.
They dip its leaves into oil and rub them against the face of a
corpse.<a class="noteref" id="n151.6src" href="#n151.6" name=
"n151.6src">15</a></p>
<p>There is a temple of Bhimn&#257;th Mah&#257;dev near Barav&#257;la
in the shade of an ancient <i>J&#257;l</i> tree. The worshipper at the
temple, a wealthy man, once thought of erecting a grand temple over the
image, but he was prevented from doing so by the god appearing in his

<p>All Hindus worship the snake. The day especially devoted to its
worship is the fifth day of the bright half of <i>Shr&#257;van</i>,
which is called <i>N&#257;g panchami</i>. In some places <i>N&#257;g

<i>Shr&#257;van</i>. On this day an image of a snake is made of cowdung
or earth, or its picture is drawn on the wall.</p>
<p>The image is worshipped as a deity, and <i>kulera</i>, a mixture of
wheat, oat or rice flour, clarified butter, and sugar or molasses is
offered to it. After worship, the members of the household take their
meal and eat <i>kulera</i>, cocoanuts and cucumbers. Only one meal is
taken on this day by men and women.<a class="noteref" id="n152.16src"

only on <i>kulera</i>. On this day, her Highness the Mah&#257;r&#257;ni

<p>It is related that there were once divine snakes in the royal fort
of Jodia. When a pair (male and female) of these snakes were found
killed, the heinous act was atoned for by the bodies of the snakes
being buried and a temple erected over the grave. The male snake of
this pair is known as N&#257;g N&#257;th or the Lord of Snakes.</p>
<p>According to others, N&#257;g N&#257;th was a big white snake with
gray moustaches. He once waylaid a milkman of the royal household,
forced him to put down the milkpot he was carrying, drank the milk and
went away. This snake is believed to be divine.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>It is a common belief that treasures buried underground are guarded

name="n154.14src">61</a></p>
<p>If in spite of this, a man succeeds in seizing the treasure by force

the spot, but was buried alive. The Th&#257;kor buried the treasure in
his castle, but the Br&#257;hman, becoming a snake, guarded the
treasure and allowed none to touch it. All attempts to dig it up were
frustrated by attacks of bees and the appearance of a snake.</p>
<p>A Kshatriya named Dev Karan, while the foundation of his house was

<p>There are many practices in vogue to render the poisonous bite of a
snake ineffective.</p>
<p>If the man bitten by a snake be bold, he cuts off the bitten
part.</p>
<p>Some have the bitten part branded.</p>
<p>Those who have no ulcer in the mouth suck the poison, and spit it
out.</p>
<p>The powder of the fruit of the <i>Nol Vel</i> is also administered
with water.</p>
<p>Sometimes emetics and purgative medicines are given.</p>
<p>A mixture of pepper and clarified butter is also believed to be
efficacious.<a class="noteref" id="n155.3src" href="#n155.3" name=

<p>Other remedies for the cure of snake bite, are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>The patient is made to wear a cotton thread in the name of
Charm&#257;lia N&#257;g, Sharmalia N&#257;g, or Vasangi N&#257;g, and
certain observances, as stated above, are promised to the snake
deity.<a class="noteref" id="n155.4src" href="#n155.4" name=

<p>The ends of peacock feathers are pounded and smoked in a
<i>chilum</i> (clay pipe) by the patient.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>A <i>moharo</i> (stone found in the head of a snake supposed to be a
cure for snake poison) is applied to the wound caused by the bite. It
absorbs the poison, and on being dipped into milk, transfers the poison
to the milk.</p>
<p>Thus it can be used any number of times.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>There is a Gir&#257;sia in Lakhtar who is believed to cure patients

one of the garments worn by him is taken to the Gir&#257;sia, who ties
it into a knot and this cures the patient.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>There is a <i>B&#257;va</i> in Rajp&#257;ra, a village near
Anandpur. He and all the members of his family are reputed to be able
to cure snake-bites. When a person is bitten by a snake, he or a friend
goes to the <i>B&#257;v&#257;&rsquo;s</i> house and informs him or any
member of his family of the occurrence. The <i>B&#257;va</i> or the
person who receives the intimation folds into a knot a garment of the
informant, which he afterwards unfolds. As soon as this is done, the
patient is in great pain, loses his senses, is seized with convulsions
and tells why the snake bit him. Thereupon the relatives of the patient
implore the pardon of the snake, which is granted on condition that the
patient should give alms to the poor.<a class="noteref" id="n155.8src"

<p>In some places, <i>Bhagats</i> or devotees of M&#257;t&#257;ji are
invited to dinner along with a number of exorcists, who are generally
Rab&#257;ris. After they have assembled at the house of the patient,
they start out in a procession headed by one who holds in his hand a
bunch of peacock feathers, to bathe in a river. On their way to and
back from the river they sing songs in praise of the goddess to the
accompaniment of drums and other musical instruments. After their
return from the river, the whole party are treated to a feast, which is
supposed to cure the patient of the effects of the snake-bite.<a class=

<p>Some people believe that snakes, like evil spirits, can enter the
bodies of human beings. Such persons, when possessed, are supposed to
have the power of curing snake-bites.<a class="noteref" id="n156.2src"
href="#n156.2" name="n156.2src">73</a></p>
<p>Every village has an exorcist who is a specialist in curing the
effects of snake-bites. When a person is bitten by a snake the exorcist
is at once sent for. He gives the patient <i>Nim</i> leaves and pepper
to chew, to determine the extent of the effect of the bite. Next he
asks one of those present to bathe and bring water in an unused earthen
jar. He then recites incantations, and sprinkles water from the jar
over the body of the patient. If this does not counteract the effects
of the poison, he throws red-hot pieces of charcoal at the patient,
when the snake speaks through the patient and states that he bit the
patient because he committed a certain offence, and that he will leave
him if certain offerings are made. After he has ceased speaking, the
patient begins to shake and to crawl about like a snake, and is then
cured. If the man be doomed to death, the snake would say, &ldquo;I
have bitten him by the order of the god of death, and I will not leave
him without taking his life.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="n156.3src"
href="#n156.3" name="n156.3src">74</a></p>
<p>Sometimes the exorcist fans the patient with branches of the
<i>Nim</i> tree, reciting <i>mantras</i>, and thereupon the patient
becomes possessed by the snake and declares the cause of his
offence.</p>
<p>Some exorcists present a magic epistle or charm asking the snake
that bit the patient to be present. The snake obeys the call, and
appears before the exorcist. The latter then asks the snake to suck the
poison from the wound of the patient, which is done by the snake, and
the patient is then cured.<a class="noteref" id="n156.4src" href=
"#n156.4" name="n156.4src">75</a></p>
<p>In some places, the exorcist ties up the patient when the snake
tells the cause of the bite. Next the exorcist calls on the snake to
leave the body of the patient, who then begins to crawl about like a
snake and is cured.</p>
<p>On some occasions, the exorcist slaps the cheek of the person who
calls him to attend the patient. It is said that the poison disappears
as soon as the slap is given.<a class="noteref" id="n156.5src" href=
"#n156.5" name="n156.5src">76</a></p>
<p>Some exorcists take a stick having seven joints and break them one
by one. As the stick is broken, the patient recovers, his recovery
being complete when the seventh joint is broken.<a class="noteref" id=
"n156.6src" href="#n156.6" name="n156.6src">77</a></p>
<p>It is believed that the Dhedas are the oldest worshippers of
<i>N&#257;gs</i> or snakes. When a person is bitten by a snake, he is
seated near a Dheda, who prays the snake to leave the body of the
patient. It is said that in some cases this method proves efficacious
in curing the patient.<a class="noteref" id="n156.7src" href="#n156.7"
name="n156.7src">78</a></p>
<p>It is stated that exorcists who know the <i>mantra</i> (incantation)
for the cure of snake-bites must lead a strictly moral life. If they
touch a woman in child-bed or during her period the <i>mantra</i> loses
its power. This can be regained through purification, bathing, and by
reciting the <i>mantra</i> while inhaling the smoke of burning
frankincense. Some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e16905" href=
"#xd26e16905" name="xd26e16905">157</a>]</span>exorcists abstain from
certain kinds of vegetables and sweets, e. g., the <i>Mogri</i>
(Rat-tailed <span class="corr" id="xd26e16911" title=
"Source: raddish">radish</span>)<span class="corr" id="xd26e16914"
title="Not in source">,</span> <i>Julebi</i> (a kind of
sweet)<span class="corr" id="xd26e16920" title="Not in source">,</span>
etc. They have also to abstain from articles of a colour like that of a
snake.<a class="noteref" id="n157.1src" href="#n157.1" name=
"n157.1src">79</a></p>
<p>A belief prevails that there is a precious stone in the head of the
snake. Such stones are called <i>mohors</i>. They are occasionally
shown to the people by snake-charmers, who declare that it is very
difficult to procure them.</p>
<p>It is stated that on dark nights snakes take these <i>mohors</i> out
of their head and place them on prominent spots in order to be able to
move about in the dark by their light.<a class="noteref" id="n157.2src"
href="#n157.2" name="n157.2src">80</a></p>
<p>It is believed that snakes give these <i>mohors</i> to those who
please them. If one tries to take a <i>mohor</i> by force, the snake
swallows it and dissolves it into water.<a class="noteref" id=
"n157.3src" href="#n157.3" name="n157.3src">81</a></p>
<p>As stated above, the <i>mohor</i> has the property of absorbing the
poison from snake-bites.</p>
<p>It is because a snake is believed to hold a precious stone in its
head that it is called <i>manidhar</i>, that is, holder of a
jewel.<a class="noteref" id="n157.4src" href="#n157.4" name=
"n157.4src">82</a></p>
<p>It is believed by some people that the <i>mohor</i> shines the most
when a rainbow appears in the sky.<a class="noteref" id="n157.5src"
href="#n157.5" name="n157.5src">83</a></p>
<p>According to the <i>Pur&#257;nas</i> the <i>p&#257;t&#257;l</i> or
nether world is as beautiful as heaven. It is inhabited by
<i>N&#257;gs</i> or snakes in human form. The <i>N&#257;g</i> girls are
reputed to be so handsome that an extraordinarily beautiful girl is
commonly likened to a <i>N&#257;g</i> girl.</p>
<p>It is believed that in ancient times inter-marriages between
<i>N&#257;gs</i> and human beings were common.<a class="noteref" id=
"n157.6src" href="#n157.6" name="n157.6src">84</a></p>
<p>It is a common belief that Kshetrap&#257;l, the guardian snake of
fields, married human brides. So to propitiate him, his image is
installed on the marriage altar, and the bride takes three turns round
it when walking round the sacrificial fire with the
bridegroom.<a class="noteref" id="n157.7src" href="#n157.7" name=
"n157.7src">85</a></p>
<p>According to the <i>Pur&#257;nas</i>, king Dasharath married a
<i>N&#257;g</i> girl Sumitra.<a class="noteref" id="n157.8src" href=
"#n157.8" name="n157.8src">86</a> Similarly Indrajit, the son of
R&#257;van, the Lord of Lanka or Ceylon, married a <i>N&#257;g</i>
girl.<a class="noteref" id="n157.9src" href="#n157.9" name=
"n157.9src">87</a></p>
<p>At times snakes are seen in houses. They are believed to be the
guardians of the houses, and worshipped with offerings of lamps fed
with ghi. After worship, the members of the family pray to the snake,
&ldquo;Oh snake! Thou art our guardian. Protect our health and wealth.
We are thy children and live in thy garden.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="n157.10src" href="#n157.10" name="n157.10src">88</a></p>
<p>Some people believe that the spirits of deceased ancestors, on
account of the anxiety for the welfare of progeny, become snakes and
guard the house.<a class="noteref" id="n157.11src" href="#n157.11"

<p>It is generally believed that the earth is supported by a tortoise.
So, whenever the goddess earth or Prithvi is worshipped, the tortoise
is also worshipped.<a class="noteref" id="n160.2src" href="#n160.2"

<p>All the gods, goddesses and spirits mentioned in the preceding pages
are represented by idols made of stone, metal or wood. In addition to
stone idols of gods there are certain stones which are considered to
represent gods and worshipped as such. Some of these stones are
described below.</p>
<p>All the stones found in the river Narbada are believed to represent
the god Shiva and worshipped.</p>
<p>There is a kind of stone found in the river Gandaki which is smooth
on one side and porous on the other. It is either round or square and
about five inches in length. This stone is called
<i>Sh&#257;ligr&#257;m</i> and is believed to represent the god Vishnu.
It is kept in the household gods and worshipped daily.</p>
<p>There is another kind of hard, white, porous stone found near
Dw&#257;rka. It is also worshipped along with the idol of Vishnu.</p>
<p>Sometimes tridents are drawn with red lead on stones to represent
goddesses.<a class="noteref" id="n160.6src" href="#n160.6" name=
"n160.6src">28</a></p>
<p>There is a tank near the Pir in Kuti&#257;na in which bored stones
are found floating on the surface of the water. These stones are
considered sacred.<a class="noteref" id="n160.7src" href="#n160.7"
name="n160.7src">29</a></p>
<p>Certain stones are considered sacred on account of their supposed
curative properties. One of such stones is called <i>P&#257;ro</i>. It
is believed to be efficacious in curing rheumatism.<a class="noteref"
id="n160.8src" href="#n160.8" name="n160.8src">30</a></p>
<p>There is also a kind of red stone which is supposed to cure skin
diseases.<a class="noteref" id="n160.9src" href="#n160.9" name=
"n160.9src">31</a></p>
<p>Each of the nine planets is supposed to be in touch with a stone of
a particular colour. For instance, the stone in touch with <i>Shani</i>
or Saturn is black, and that with <i>Mangal</i> or Mars is red. These
stones are bored, and set in rings which are worn by persons suffering
from the influence of these planets.</p>
<p>A kind of stone called <i>Akik</i>, found in abundance in Cambay, is
considered sacred by the Mahomedan saints, who wear garlands made of
beads carved out of these stones.<a class="noteref" id="n160.10src"
href="#n160.10" name="n160.10src">32</a></p>
<p>In ancient times human sacrifices were offered on certain occasions.
Now-a-days, in place of a human being, a cocoanut or a <i>Kolu</i>
(<span lang="la">Cucurbita maxima</span>) is offered. At the time of
making the offering, the cocoanut is plastered with red lead and other
holy applications and covered with a silk cloth. The <i>Kolu</i> is
offered by cutting it into two pieces with a stroke of a knife or
sword.<a class="noteref" id="n160.11src" href="#n160.11" name=
"n160.11src">33</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e17748" href=
"#xd26e17748" name="xd26e17748">161</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sometimes an image of the flour of <i>Adad</i> is sacrificed in
place of a human being.<a class="noteref" id="n161.1src" href="#n161.1"
name="n161.1src">34</a></p>
<p>This sacrifice is generally made on the eighth or tenth day of the
bright half of <i>Ashvin</i>.</p>
<p>In place of human blood, milk mixed with <i>gul&#257;l</i> (red
powder) and molasses is offered.<a class="noteref" id="n161.2src" href=
"#n161.2" name="n161.2src">35</a></p>
<p>In ancient times, when a well was dug, a human sacrifice was made to
it if it did not yield water, with the belief that this would bring
water into the well. Now-a-days, instead of this sacrifice, blood from
the fourth finger of a man is sprinkled over the spot.<a class=
"noteref" id="n161.3src" href="#n161.3" name="n161.3src">36</a></p>
<p>It is also related that in ancient times, when a king was crowned, a
human sacrifice was offered. Now-a-days, instead of this sacrifice, the
king&rsquo;s forehead is marked with the blood from the fourth finger
of a low caste Hindu at the time of the coronation ceremony.<a class=
"noteref" id="n161.4src" href="#n161.4" name="n161.4src">37</a></p>
<p>There are a few stones which are supposed to have the power of
curing certain diseases. One of such stones is known as <i>Ratvano
P&#257;ro</i>. It is found at a distance of about two miles from Kolki.
It is marked with red lines. It is bored and worn round the neck by
persons suffering from <i>ratawa</i><a class="noteref" id="n161.5src"
href="#n161.5" name="n161.5src">38</a> (a disease in which red spots or
pimples are seen on the skin).</p>
<p>There is another stone called <i>Suleimani P&#257;ro</i> which is
supposed to have the power of curing many diseases.<a class="noteref"
id="n161.6src" href="#n161.6" name="n161.6src">39</a></p>
<p>There is a kind of white semi-circular stone which is supposed to
cure eye diseases when rubbed on the eyes and fever when rubbed on the
body.<a class="noteref" id="n161.7src" href="#n161.7" name=
"n161.7src">40</a></p>
<p>Sieves for flour and corn, brooms, <i>sambelus</i> or corn pounders,
and ploughs are regarded as sacred.</p>
<p>Sieves are considered sacred for the following reasons.</p>
<p>1. Because articles of food such as flour, grain, etc., are sifted
through them.<a class="noteref" id="n161.8src" href="#n161.8" name=
"n161.8src">41</a></p>
<p>2. Because, on auspicious occasions, when women go to worship the
potter&rsquo;s wheel, the materials of worship are carried in a
sieve.</p>
<p>3. Because the fire used for igniting the sacrificial fuel is taken
in a sieve, or is covered with a sieve while it is being carried to the
sacrificial altar.<a class="noteref" id="n161.9src" href="#n161.9"
name="n161.9src">42</a></p>
<p>4. Because at the time of performing the ceremony when commencing to
prepare sweets for a marriage, a sieve is worshipped.<a class="noteref"
id="n161.10src" href="#n161.10" name="n161.10src">43</a></p>
<p>5. Because, in some communities like the Bh&#257;ti&#257;s, the
bride&rsquo;s mother, when receiving the bridegroom in the marriage
booth, carries in a dish a lamp covered with a sieve.<a class="noteref"
id="n161.11src" href="#n161.11" name="n161.11src">44</a></p>
<p>The flour collected by Br&#257;hmans by begging from door to door is
supposed to be polluted. But it is considered purified when it is
passed through a sieve.<a class="noteref" id="n161.12src" href=
"#n161.12" name="n161.12src">45</a></p>
<p>The <i>sambelu</i> is considered so sacred that it is not touched
with the foot. If a woman lie down during day time, she will not touch
it either with her head or with her foot.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why it is considered sacred is that it was used
as a weapon by Baldev, the brother of the god Krishna.</p>
<p>A <i>sambelu</i> is one of the articles, required for performing the
reception ceremony on a bridegroom&rsquo;s entering the marriage
<i>pandal</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n161.13src" href="#n161.13" name=
"n161.13src">46</a></p>
<p>It is believed that a fall of rain is expedited by placing a
<i>sambelu</i> erect in a dish when there is a drought.<a class=
"noteref" id="n161.14src" href="#n161.14" name="n161.14src">47</a></p>
<p>Among Shrigaud Br&#257;hmans, on the marriage day, one of the men of
the bridegroom&rsquo;s party wears a wreath made of a <i>sambelu</i>, a
broom and other articles. Some special marks are also made on his
forehead. Thus adorned, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e17872"
href="#xd26e17872" name="xd26e17872">162</a>]</span>goes with the
bridegroom&rsquo;s procession and plays jokes with the parents of both
the bride and bridegroom. His doing so is supposed to bless the bridal
pair with a long life and a large family.<a class="noteref" id=
"n162.1src" href="#n162.1" name="n162.1src">48</a></p>
<p>On the marriage day, after the ceremony of propitiating the nine
planets has been performed in the bride&rsquo;s house, in some castes
three, and in others one <i>sambelu</i>, is kept near the spot where
the planets are worshipped. Next, five unwidowed women of the family
hold the <i>sambelus</i> and thrash them five or seven times on the
floor repeating the words &ldquo;On the chest of the ill-wisher of the
host.&rdquo; The <i>sambelus</i> are bound together by a
thread.<a class="noteref" id="n162.2src" href="#n162.2" name=
"n162.2src">49</a></p>
<p>If a woman has to take part in an auspicious ceremony on the fourth
day of her monthly period, she is made to thresh one maund of rice with
a <i>sambelu</i>. Her fourth day is then considered as the
fifth<a class="noteref" id="n162.asrc" href="#n162.a" name=
"n162.asrc">50</a> and she becomes eligible for taking part in the
ceremony.<a class="noteref" id="n162.3src" href="#n162.3" name=
"n162.3src">51</a></p>
<p>The plough is considered sacred, because it is the chief implement
for cultivating the soil. It is worshipped on the full-moon day of
<i>Shr&#257;van</i> which is known as a <i>Balev</i> holiday, the
worship being called <i>Grahan-pujan</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"n162.4src" href="#n162.4" name="n162.4src">52</a></p>
<p>Some people consider the plough sacred because Sita, the consort of
R&#257;m, was born of the earth by the touch of a plough.<a class=
"noteref" id="n162.5src" href="#n162.5" name="n162.5src">53</a> Others
hold it sacred as it was used as a weapon by Baldev, the brother of the
god Krishna.</p>
<p>On account of the sanctity which attaches to the plough, it forms
part of the articles, with which a bridegroom is received in the
marriage <i>pandal</i> by the bride&rsquo;s mother.<a class="noteref"
id="n162.6src" href="#n162.6" name="n162.6src">54</a></p>
<p>It is related that king Janak ploughed the soil on which he had to
perform a sacrifice. Hence it has become a practice to purify with a
plough the spot on which a sacrifice is to be performed.<a class=
"noteref" id="n162.7src" href="#n162.7" name="n162.7src">55</a></p>
<p>In some places, on the <i>Balev</i> day, a number of persons gather
together near a pond, and each of them fills an earthen jar with the
water of the pond. Next, one of the party is made to stand at a long
distance from the others with a small plough in his hands. The others
then run a race towards the latter. He who wins the race is presented
with molasses and a cocoanut.<a class="noteref" id="n162.8src" href=
"#n162.8" name="n162.8src">56</a></p>
<p>It is customary among Br&#257;hmans to perform the worship known as
<i>Balevi&#257;n</i> after the performance of a thread ceremony. In
Native States, the prime minister and other State officials and clerks
join the ceremony, the principal function of the ceremony being
performed by the prime minister. In villages, this function is
performed by the headman of the village. The party go in procession to
a neighbouring village or a pond where an earthen image of Ganpati
besmeared with red lead is installed on a red cloth two feet square.
Near this image are installed the nine planets, represented by nine
heaps of corn, on each of which is placed a betelnut. This is called
the installation of <i>Balevi&#257;n</i>. A plough about two feet in
length is kept standing near the <i>Balevi&#257;n</i> with its end
buried in the ground. The prime minister or the village headman
worships the plough, after which, four Kumbh&#257;rs or potters wash
themselves, and holding four jars on their heads, run a race. Each of
the Kumbh&#257;rs is named after one of the four months of the rainy
season. He who wins the race is presented with the plough. The expenses
of the ceremony are paid from the State treasury or the village
fund.<a class="noteref" id="n162.9src" href="#n162.9" name=
"n162.9src">57</a></p>
<p>According to a popular saying, a broom should not be kept erect or
trampled under foot. This indicates that brooms are held sacred.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e17959" href="#xd26e17959" name=
"xd26e17959">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>When a newly-born infant does not cry, the leaves of a broom are
thrown into the fire and their smoke is passed over the child. It is
said that this makes the child cry.<a class="noteref" id="n163.1src"
href="#n163.1" name="n163.1src">58</a></p>
<p>Some people consider brooms sacred, because they are used in
sweeping the ground<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n163.1">58</a> (that
is the earth, which is a goddess).</p>
<p>In some places, children suffering from cough are fanned with a
broom.<a class="noteref" id="n163.2src" href="#n163.2" name=
"n163.2src">59</a></p>
<p>In some castes, a broom is worshipped on the marriage day.<a class=
"noteref" id="n163.3src" href="#n163.3" name="n163.3src">60</a></p>
<p>Many people deny any sanctity to a broom. A belief is common that if
a man sees a broom the first thing after getting up in the morning, he
does not pass the day happily.<a class="noteref" id="n163.4src" href=
"#n163.4" name="n163.4src">61</a></p>
<p>Some believe that if a broom be kept erect in the house, a quarrel
between the husband and wife is sure to follow. There is also a belief
that if a person thrashes another with a broom, the former is liable to
suffer from a gland under the arm.<a class="noteref" id="n163.5src"
href="#n163.5" name="n163.5src">62</a></p>
<p>Fire is considered to be a deity by all Hindus. In all sacrifices,
fire is first ignited with certain ceremonies of worship.<a class=
"noteref" id="n163.6src" href="#n163.6" name="n163.6src">63</a> In all
Br&#257;hman families, every morning before breakfast, a ceremony
called <i>Vaishvadeva</i> is performed, in which fire is worshipped and
cooked rice is offered to it.<a class="noteref" id="n163.7src" href=
"#n163.7" name="n163.7src">64</a></p>
<p>The <i>Agnihotris</i> keep a constant fire burning in their houses
and worship it thrice a day, morning, noon and evening<a class=
"noteref" id="n163.8src" href="#n163.8" name="n163.8src">65</a>.</p>
<p>The P&#257;rsis consider fire so sacred that they do not smoke.
Neither do they cross fire. In their temples called <i>Agi&#257;ris</i>
a fire of sandal wood is kept constantly burning. It is considered a
great mishap if this fire is extinguished.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n163.8">65</a></p>
<p>Fire is specially worshipped on the <i>Holi</i> day, that is the
full-moon day of the month of <i>F&#257;lgun</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"n163.9src" href="#n163.9" name="n163.9src">66</a></p>
<p>Other special occasions on which it is worshipped are the thread
ceremony, the ceremony of installing a new idol in a temple, the first
pregnancy ceremony, and the ceremony performed at the time of entering
a new house.<a class="noteref" id="n163.10src" href="#n163.10" name=
"n163.10src">67</a></p>
<p>Fire is also worshipped in <i>Mah&#257;rudra</i>,
<i>Vishnuy&#257;g</i>, <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e18045" title=

<i>Nil&#333;tsarga</i>, <i>V&#257;stupujan</i>, <i>Shatachandi</i>,
<i>Lakshachandi</i>, and the sacrifices performed during the
<i>Navar&#257;tra</i> and on the <i>Dasara</i> day.<a class="noteref"
id="n163.11src" href="#n163.11" name="n163.11src">68</a></p>
<p>Fire is considered to be the mouth of God, through which he is
supposed to receive all offerings.<a class="noteref" id="n163.12src"
href="#n163.12" name="n163.12src">69</a></p>
<p>The offerings made to fire generally consist of clarified butter,

worshipped by the Hindus.</p>
<p>1. The cow:&mdash;is regarded as the holiest of animals. She is
worshipped on the fourth day of the dark half of <i>Shr&#257;van</i>
which is known as <i>Bol Choth</i>;<a class="noteref" id="n164.asrc"
href="#n164.a" name="n164.asrc">1</a> and a vow is observed by women in
her honour on the fifteenth day of <i><span class="corr" id=
"xd26e18135" title=
"Source: Bh&#257;darva">Bh&#257;darv&#257;</span></i>. It is known as
<i>Gautrad Vrat</i>. On this day women do not eat wheat, milk,
clarified butter and the whey of a cow.<a class="noteref" id=
"n164.1src" href="#n164.1" name="n164.1src">2</a></p>
<p>The sanctity which attaches to the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e18147" title="Not in source">cow is</span> due to the belief that
in her body reside thirty three crores of gods.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>2. The horse:&mdash;The horse is believed by some people to be the
last incarnation of God. It is also believed to represent
V&#257;chhado, the deity who cures hydrophobia.<a class="noteref" id=

that in ancient times it had wings, traces of which are believed to be
still visible in its knees.</p>
<p>Of the fourteen jewels obtained by the gods and demons by churning
the ocean, one was a horse with seven mouths. Hence the horse is

name="n164.4src">5</a></p>
<p>The horse is worshipped on the <i>Dasara</i> day.<a class="noteref"
id="n164.5src" href="#n164.5" name="n164.5src">6</a></p>
<p>3. The elephant:&mdash;The elephant is considered divine because it
is the vehicle of Indra, the lord of gods, and because its head was
fixed on the trunk of Ganpati, the son of P&#257;rvati and Shiva. It is

goddesses.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n164.4">5</a></p>
<p>5. The tiger:&mdash;The tiger is worshipped with V&#257;gheshvari

"Source: M&#257;ta">M&#257;t&#257;</span> as it is believed to be her
vehicle.</p>
<p>6. The she-buffalo:&mdash;Some sanctity attaches to the she-buffalo,
as it is believed that a she-buffalo was given in dowry to a
<i>N&#257;g kanya</i> (snake girl) by her father.<a class="noteref" id=
"n164.8src" href="#n164.8" name="n164.8src">9</a></p>
<p>To atone for a great sin a she-buffalo decked with a black wreath,
iron, red lead and marks made with the flour of <i>adad</i> is

<p>It is also believed that the god Brahma had formerly five mouths,
one of which was like that of a donkey.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>8. The dog:&mdash;The dog is believed to have divine vision and to

<p>The dog is also believed to be the vehicle of K&#257;l Bhairav and
is worshipped along with his image.<a class="noteref" id="n164.13src"
href="#n164.13" name="n164.13src">14</a></p>

man can win over his opponents.<a class="noteref" id="n165.2src" href=
"#n165.2" name="n165.2src">17</a></p>
<p>11. The bear:&mdash;is considered by some people to be a holy animal
because the god Krishna married J&#257;mbuvanti, the daughter of
J&#257;mbuvant, the heroic bear who assisted R&#257;ma.<a class=
"noteref" id="n165.3src" href="#n165.3" name="n165.3src">18</a></p>
<p>12. Fish:&mdash;are considered sacred because they are supposed to
carry the food (<i>pindas</i>) to the <i>manes</i> offered (in water)
at the <i>shr&#257;ddha</i> ceremony.<a class="noteref" id="n165.4src"
href="#n165.4" name="n165.4src">19</a></p>

represent <i>rishis</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n165.6src" href=
"#n165.6" name="n165.6src">21</a></p>
<p>Some people believe that crows were formerly <i>rishis</i>. They are
supposed to have divine vision, and food offered to them is believed to
reach deceased ancestors.</p>
<p>A loaf is cut into three parts. One of them is designated
<i>k&#257;l</i> (ordinary), the second <i>duk&#257;l</i> (famine), and
the third <i>suk&#257;l</i> (plenty). Next they are offered to a crow.
If the crow takes away the <i>k&#257;l</i>, it is believed that the
crops in the following year will be normal; if it takes away the
<i>duk&#257;l</i> a famine is apprehended in the following year, and if
the <i>suk&#257;l</i>, it is believed that the crops will be
plentiful.<a class="noteref" id="n165.7src" href="#n165.7" name=
"n165.7src">22</a></p>
<p>15. The goose:&mdash;is supposed to be the vehicle of the goddess
Sarasvati. It is believed that its worship ensures success in any
enterprise. If a goose is seen in a dream, it is considered to be a
very good omen.<a class="noteref" id="n165.8src" href="#n165.8" name=
"n165.8src">23</a></p>

order of ghosts.<a class="noteref" id="n166.1src" href="#n166.1" name=

<p>Girls born in the <i>Ashlesha nakshatra</i> on the <i>bij</i> or
second day of a month, in the <i>Kritika nakshatra</i> on the seventh
day of a month and in the <i>Shatabhigha nakshatra</i> on the twelfth
day of a month, are believed to be human <i>d&#257;kans</i>. They cause
the death of their husbands, and their evil eye injures all things and
individuals that come under its influence.<a class="noteref" id=
"n166.2src" href="#n166.2" name="n166.2src">2</a></p>
<p>Women who die in child-bed, meet an untimely death or commit
suicide, become <i>D&#257;kans</i> or <i>Chudels</i> after
death.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n166.2">2</a></p>
<p>Some people believe that women of such low castes as Kolis,
V&#257;ghris and Ch&#257;rans become <i>D&#257;kans</i>. High caste
<i>D&#257;kans</i> are rare.<a class="noteref" id="n166.3src" href=
"#n166.3" name="n166.3src">3</a></p>
<p>A ghostly <i>D&#257;kan</i> dresses in fine clothes and decks her
person with ornaments. But she does not cover her back, which is
horrible to look at. It is so frightful that any one happening to see
it dies of horror.<a class="noteref" id="n166.4src" href="#n166.4"
name="n166.4src">4</a></p>
<p>Ghostly <i>D&#257;kans</i> trouble only women. When possessed by
them, the latter have convulsive fits, loose their hair, and cry out
without any reason.<a class="noteref" id="n166.5src" href="#n166.5"
name="n166.5src">5</a></p>
<p>A ghostly <i>D&#257;kan</i> lives with a man as his wife, brings him
dainties and turns the refuse of food into flesh and bones. The man
gradually becomes emaciated and ultimately dies.<a class="noteref" id=
"n166.6src" href="#n166.6" name="n166.6src">6</a></p>

months.<a class="noteref" id="n166.7src" href="#n166.7" name=
"n166.7src">7</a></p>
<p>The <i>D&#257;kans</i> do not allow calves to suck, cattle to give
milk, and healthy persons to enjoy sound health. Sometimes they cause
cattle to yield blood instead of milk.<a class="noteref" id="n166.8src"
href="#n166.8" name="n166.8src">8</a></p>
<p>A <i>D&#257;kan</i> by virtue of her powers, can ascend to the sky.
She lives upon the flesh of corpses.<a class="noteref" id="n166.9src"
href="#n166.9" name="n166.9src">9</a></p>
<p>A <i>D&#257;kan</i> can assume any form she likes. She appears as a
cat, a buffalo, a goat or any other animal. She can swell and shrink
her body at will. Her feet are reversed.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">Various ceremonies are performed by cultivators at the
time of ploughing the soil, sowing, reaping and harvesting. These
ceremonies differ in details in different localities.</p>
<p>In all places, an auspicious day for ploughing and sowing is fixed
in consultation with an astrologer. On the day when ploughing is to be
commenced, the front court yard of the house is cowdunged and an
auspicious figure called <i>Sathia</i><a class="noteref" id="n167.asrc"
href="#n167.a" name="n167.asrc">1</a> is drawn on it with the grains of
<i>juv&#257;ri</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n167.1src" href="#n167.1"
name="n167.1src">2</a></p>
<p>A dish called <i>kans&#257;r</i> is prepared, and served to all
members of the family at the morning meal. Their foreheads are marked
with red powder, and a pice and betelnut are offered to the household
gods. Hand-spun cotton threads marked at intervals with red powder are
then tied round the plough and to the horns of the bullocks which are
to be yoked to the plough.<a class="noteref" id="n167.2src" href=
"#n167.2" name="n167.2src">3</a></p>
<p>Next, the farmer stands waiting at the front door of his house for
good omens,<a class="noteref" id="n167.3src" href="#n167.3" name=
"n167.3src">4</a> and when a few are seen, sets out for his field.</p>
<p>In some places, the foreheads of the bullocks are daubed with red
lead, clarified butter is applied to their horns, and they are fed with
molasses.<a class="noteref" id="n167.4src" href="#n167.4" name=
"n167.4src">5</a></p>
<p>In others, a betelnut is placed over the <i>Sathia</i> and given to
the person who first meets the farmer on leaving his house.<a class=
"noteref" id="n167.5src" href="#n167.5" name="n167.5src">6</a></p>
<p>In some localities again, the farmer holds the plough over the
<i>Sathia</i>, touching it with the end, eats a morsel of molasses, and
bows to the <i>Sathia</i> before starting.<a class="noteref" id=
"n167.6src" href="#n167.6" name="n167.6src">7</a></p>
<p>As a rule, seed is not sown on Saturdays or Tuesdays. Wednesday is
believed to be the most favourable day for this purpose.<a class=
"noteref" id="n167.7src" href="#n167.7" name="n167.7src">8</a></p>
<p>Sowing is commenced from that corner of the field which has been
pronounced by the astrologer to be the best for the operation.<a class=
"noteref" id="n167.8src" href="#n167.8" name="n167.8src">9</a></p>
<p>Sunday is believed to be the most auspicious day for
reaping.<a class="noteref" id="n167.9src" href="#n167.9" name=
"n167.9src">10</a> While reaping, a part of the crop is offered to the
image of Kshetrap&#257;l and to other village deities. In order to
secure a good harvest, sweets are offered to the village gods on the
eighth or tenth day of the bright half of <i>Ashvin</i> or on the
second day of the bright half of <i>K&#257;rtik</i> which is called
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e18549" title=

"n167.10src" href="#n167.10" name="n167.10src">11</a></p>
<p>No crop is brought into the house before a part of it has been
offered to the local deities.<a class="noteref" id="n167.11src" href=
"#n167.11" name="n167.11src">12</a></p>
<p>When juice is to be extracted from sugar-canes, the mill is first
worshipped. In the shed erected for storing the jars of molasses, an
image of Ganpati is installed, and worshipped before placing the jars
in the shed.<a class="noteref" id="n167.12src" href="#n167.12" name=
"n167.12src">13</a></p>
<p>The first jar of molasses and two bits of sugar cane are offered to
the local deities.<a class="noteref" id="n167.13src" href="#n167.13"
name="n167.13src">14</a></p>
<p>Before reaping cotton, offerings are made to the village
gods.<a class="noteref" id="n167.14src" href="#n167.14" name=
"n167.14src">15</a></p>
<p>When a cow or she-buffalo is about to calve a packet containing a
few pebbles or cowries, the <i>mali</i> (red lead) from the image of
Hanum&#257;n, dust collected from a place where four roads meet, and
grains of <i>Adad</i>, are tied to its horns by an indigo-coloured
thread, in the belief that this protects the animal from the effects of
the evil eye.<a class="noteref" id="n167.15src" href="#n167.15" name=
"n167.15src">16</a></p>
<p>To guard cattle against an attack of small-pox, women observe a vow
called <i>Shili S&#257;tem</i> on the seventh day of the bright half of
<i>Shr&#257;van</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n167.16src" href="#n167.16"
name="n167.16src">17</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e18597"
href="#xd26e18597" name="xd26e18597">168</a>]</span></p>
<p>To prevent a tiger from attacking cattle, a circle of the flour of
<i>charonthi</i> is drawn round them by an exorcist reciting
<i>mantras</i> or incantations. If a tiger tries to enter this
protected area its mouth at once becomes swollen.<a class="noteref" id=
"n168.1src" href="#n168.1" name="n168.1src">18</a></p>
<p>In some places, salt heated over the fire of the <i>Holi</i> is put
into the food given to the cattle in the belief that this protects them
from disease.<a class="noteref" id="n168.2src" href="#n168.2" name=
"n168.2src">19</a></p>
<p>Instead of salt, some people give cattle leaves of castor-oil plants
roasted over the fire of the <i>Holi</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"n168.3src" href="#n168.3" name="n168.3src">20</a></p>
<p>In some places, on the <i>Div&#257;li</i> holiday, a torch and a
rice pounder are placed in the cattle shed, and the cattle are made to
cross them one by one. This process is believed to protect them from
disease.<a class="noteref" id="n168.4src" href="#n168.4" name=
"n168.4src">21</a></p>
<p>A ceremony called the <i>Doro</i> of Mah&#257;dev is also performed
in the month of <i>Shr&#257;van</i> to protect cattle against
disease.<a class="noteref" id="n168.5src" href="#n168.5" name=
"n168.5src">22</a></p>
<p>Vows in the honour of Ashp&#257;l or N&#257;gdev are also observed
for the protection of cattle.<a class="noteref" id="n168.6src" href=
"#n168.6" name="n168.6src">23</a></p>
<p>In the <i>Hasta nakshatra</i> during the monsoon, when there is a
thunder storm, a <i>s&#257;mbelu</i> (rice pounder) is struck seven
times against the main cross beam of the house in the belief that the
sound thus produced destroys insects.<a class="noteref" id="n168.7src"
href="#n168.7" name="n168.7src">24</a></p>
<p>To scare the insects called <i>itidio</i>, vows are observed in
honour of the Itidio Pir.<a class="noteref" id="n168.8src" href=

<p>In order that insects and worms may not spoil the corn stored in a
granary or in earthen jars, the ashes of the fire of the <i>Holi</i> or
leaves of the <i>nim</i> tree are mixed with it.</p>
<p>To prevent insects from spoiling wheat, <i>b&#257;jari</i> and
<i>juv&#257;ri</i>, mercury and ashes are put into them, while it is
believed that gram cannot be eaten by insects if it is mixed with dust
from a place where three roads meet.<a class="noteref" id="n168.9src"

<p>To drive away insects, a ceremony called <i>Adagho Badagho</i> or
<i>Mariyun</i> is performed on the <i>Div&#257;li</i> holiday. It is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>One man holds a lighted torch in his hand, and another an earthen
jar, which he beats with a small stick. The two men pass through every
nook and corner of the house and the cattle-shed crying
&ldquo;<i>Adagho</i> may go, <i>Badagho</i> may go&rdquo;, that is,
&ldquo;May troubles and diseases disappear; may bugs, serpents, mice,
scorpions, mosquitoes and other insects die out.&rdquo; Next they
proceed, repeating the same words, through the streets to the village
boundary, where the torch, the earthen jar and the stick are thrown
away, thus ending the ceremony.<a class="noteref" id="n168.10src" href=
"#n168.10" name="n168.10src">27</a></p>
<p>In order to secure sunshine and favourable weather, oblations are
offered to the local deities, sacrificial offerings are made and
bunting is suspended from the doors of temples.<a class="noteref" id=
"n168.11src" href="#n168.11" name="n168.11src">28</a></p>
<p>In order to secure a favourable rainfall, a grand festival is
observed on an auspicious day. On this day all agricultural work is
stopped and <i>megh laddus</i> (sweet balls called <i>megh</i> or
cloud) are eaten by the people.<a class="noteref" id="n168.12src" href=
"#n168.12" name="n168.12src">29</a></p>
<p>In some places, for the protection of the crops, a thread charmed by
the incantations of an exorcist is passed round the hedge of the
field.<a class="noteref" id="n168.13src" href="#n168.13" name=
"n168.13src">30</a></p>
<p>For the protection of crops of gram, wheat and sugar-cane against
injury by rats, a ceremony called <i>D&#257;dh B&#257;ndhavi</i> is
performed, in which a thread over which incantations have been repeated
by an exorcist is passed round the crop, and an image of Ganpati is
installed and worshipped with offerings of sweet balls of wheat
flour.<a class="noteref" id="n168.14src" href="#n168.14" name=

<p>In some places, the ceremony of <i>D&#257;dh B&#257;ndhavi</i> is
performed somewhat differently. Instead of passing a thread round the
field, the exorcist walks round the field repeating incantations,
holding in his hand a pot containing fire, over which is placed a pan
containing <i>Gugal</i>. This ceremony is generally performed for the
protection of sugar-cane crops against the attacks of jackals. It is
believed that an animal entering the field after the performance of
this ceremony has its <i>d&#257;dh</i> (gums) stiffened.<a class=

<p>There are various legends current among the people regarding the
origin of the <i>Holi</i> holiday. The chief versions are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. In ancient times there lived a demoness named Dhunda who preyed
upon children. Her misdeeds caused great misery to the people, who went
to Vasishtha, the preceptor of R&#257;ma, and implored him to tell them
of some remedy for the mischief wrought by the demoness. Vasishtha told
them to light a pyre in honour of the goddess Holika, which he said,
would consume the demoness. The people accordingly lighted a huge fire,
into which the demoness was driven by boys who led her to the spot by
abusing her and troubling her in many ways. She was reduced to ashes by
the fire, and the people were saved.<a class="noteref" id="n169.8src"
href="#n169.8" name="n169.8src">39</a></p>
<p>2. A demon named Hirani&#257;ksha had a sister named Holika and a
son named Prahl&#257;d. Hirani&#257;ksha bore great enmity to
R&#257;ma, while Prahl&#257;d was his devotee. Hirani&#257;ksha did not
like his son&rsquo;s devotion to R&#257;ma, and told him several times
to give it up, and even threatened to take his life. But Prahl&#257;d
did not swerve an inch from the path of his devotion. At last, being
desperate, Hirani&#257;ksha decided to kill him, and entrusted his
sister with the mission. Holika raised a big pile of cow-dung cakes,
set it on fire, and seated herself on the pile, taking Prahl&#257;d in
her lap. But through the grace of R&#257;ma, Prahl&#257;d escaped
uninjured while Holika was reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>3. A demoness called Dhunda had obtained a boon from Shiva to the
effect that she would not meet her death during any of the three
seasons of the year, either by day or by night. At the same time she
was warned to beware of injury from children between sunset and
nightfall at the commencement of a new season. To prevent any
possibility of injury from children, she began to destroy them by
preying upon their bodies. This caused a great panic among the people,
who went to Vasishtha and asked his advice as to how to kill the
demoness. He advised them to kill her in the way <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e18817" href="#xd26e18817" name=
"xd26e18817">170</a>]</span>described in legend No. I above, and she
was killed accordingly.<a class="noteref" id="n170.1src" href="#n170.1"
name="n170.1src">40</a></p>
<p>4. The Govardhan mountain had two sisters named Holi and
Div&#257;li. Holi was a woman of bad conduct while Div&#257;li&rsquo;s
character was good. Although unchaste, Holi boasted that she was
chaste, and once, to prove her chastity, she threw herself on to a big
fire. She could not bear the pain caused by the flames, and began to
scream aloud, when people beat drums, abused her, and raised such a din
that her screams became inaudible. Hence the custom of using abusive
language and reciting abusive verses during the <i>Holi</i> holidays.
Govardhan could not bear the disgrace attached to his sister&rsquo;s
reputation. So he threw himself into the fire and met his death without
uttering a word of pain. This has given rise to the custom of throwing
into the <i>Holi</i> fire the cow-dung image of Govardhan, which is
installed during the <i>Div&#257;li</i> holidays.<a class="noteref" id=
"n170.2src" href="#n170.2" name="n170.2src">41</a></p>
<p>On the <i>Holi</i> day sweet dishes are prepared and taken with the
morning meal. Some women observe a vow on this day, and dine once only
in the evening, after worshipping the <i>Holi</i> fire with an offering
of a cocoanut and walking seven times round it.<a class="noteref" id=
"n170.3src" href="#n170.3" name="n170.3src">42</a></p>
<p>In some places, on the day preceding the <i>Holi</i>, which is known
as <i>Kamala Holi</i>, sweet stuffed cakes are prepared, and on the
<i>Holi Punema</i> day vermicelli is eaten.<a class="noteref" id=
"n170.4src" href="#n170.4" name="n170.4src">43</a></p>
<p>The fuel for the <i>Holi</i> fire is generally collected by boys. At
about two in the afternoon on the <i>Holi</i> day a party of boys goes
from house to house and receive five to fifteen cow-dung cakes from
each household. These cow-dung cakes are bored, and strung on
strings.<a class="noteref" id="n170.5src" href="#n170.5" name=
"n170.5src">44</a></p>
<p>The fuel thus collected is heaped at the village boundary or the end
of the street. All the male residents of the village or street meet at
the spot, a pit is dug, and earthen pots filled with wheat, gram and
water mixed together are placed in the pit and covered with cow-dung
cakes. Next, the headman of the village or the leading resident of the
street worships the pile with the assistance of a Br&#257;hman priest.
After worship, the pile is lighted, at the time fixed by an
astrologer,<a class="noteref" id="n170.asrc" href="#n170.a" name=
"n170.asrc">45</a> by a low caste Hindu, generally a Bhangi or
Kotw&#257;l, as Hindus of good caste consider it a sin to kindle the
<i>Holi</i> fuel. The Bhangi or Kotw&#257;l receives a few dates and
cocoanut kernel for this service.<a class="noteref" id="n170.6src"
href="#n170.6" name="n170.6src">46</a></p>
<p>The offerings thrown into the <i>Holi</i> fire generally consist of
fried <i>juv&#257;ri</i> grain, fried gram and cocoanuts. Flowers of
mango trees and tender mango fruits are also thrown into the
<i>Holi</i> fire. It is believed that newly married pairs, by
worshipping the <i>Holi</i> fire, are blessed with long life,
prosperity, and the birth of children. After the principal ceremony is
over, they worship it one by one with the ends of their upper garments
tied in a knot, and walk seven times round the fire with their hands
folded, the husband leading the wife.<a class="noteref" id="n170.7src"
href="#n170.7" name="n170.7src">47</a></p>
<p>Infants dressed in gay clothes and decked with garlands of dry dates
and bits of cocoanut kernel are also taken to the <i>Holi</i> fire by
their parents. The latter worship the <i>Holi</i> <span class="corr"
id="xd26e18908" title="Source: M&#257;ta">M&#257;t&#257;</span> and
walk four times round the fire, taking the children in their arms. Next
they offer cocoanuts to the goddess, which are either thrown into the
fire or <span class="corr" id="xd26e18911" title=
"Source: d stributed">distributed</span> among those present.<a class=
"noteref" id="n170.8src" href="#n170.8" name="n170.8src">48</a></p>
<p>Women whose children die in infancy observe a vow of remaining
standing on the <i>Holi</i> day. When the <i>Holi</i> is lighted they
worship the fire, after which they may sit down and take their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e18925" href="#xd26e18925" name=
"xd26e18925">171</a>]</span>meal. It is believed that the observance of
this vow ensures long life to children.<a class="noteref" id=
"n171.1src" href="#n171.1" name="n171.1src">49</a></p>
<p>Although the <i>Holi</i> itself falls on the full-moon day of
<i>F&#257;lgun</i> the rejoicings connected with it commence from the
first day of that month. The principal feature of the rejoicings
consists in indulging in indecent and vulgar songs and language. Vulgar
songs or <i>f&#257;gs</i> in honour of the goddess Holi are also sung.
Songs are composed abusing each caste, and sung addressing passers by,
by groups of boys who have full license during the <i>Holi</i> holidays
to indulge in all sorts of pranks and abuses.</p>
<p>Some make wooden blocks with engravings of vulgar and indecent
words, dip them in coloured water, and press them on the clothes of
passers by.</p>
<p>Others make naked idols of mud, and place them on the tops of
houses.<a class="noteref" id="n171.2src" href="#n171.2" name=
"n171.2src">50</a></p>
<p>The day following the <i>Holi</i> is known as <i>Dhul
P&#257;davo</i> or <i>Dhuleti</i>. On this day people indulge in the
throwing of cow-dung, black pigments, urine, mud, coloured water and
red powder.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n171.2">50</a></p>
<p>In some places, on the <i>Dhuleti</i> day, a game is played with a
cocoanut. The players form themselves into two parties and stand
opposite to one another. Midway between them is placed a cocoanut. Each
party tries to take away the cocoanut, and prevents the other from so
doing by throwing stones and cow-dung cakes. The party which succeeds
in taking away the cocoanut wins the game.<a class="noteref" id=
"n171.3src" href="#n171.3" name="n171.3src">51</a></p>
<p>Amongst Dheds, Kolis, R&#257;vals and other low castes a post of the
wood of the tamarind tree is planted in the ground and surrounded by
women holding whips and cords in their hands. A party of men run to the
women to drive them away and take possession of the post. The women
prevent them from doing so by striking them with all their might with
the whips and cords in their hands. This struggle commences at 10
<span class="sc">A. M.</span> on the <i>Dhuleti</i> day and continues
till one o&rsquo;clock in the morning on the following day. At last the
men succeed in carrying away the post, thus ending the game.<a class=
"noteref" id="n171.4src" href="#n171.4" name="n171.4src">52</a></p>
<p>In some places, a man is tied to a bier as if he were a corpse, and
carried on the shoulders of four men to the post of tamarind wood,
followed by a party of men and women wailing aloud, to the great
merriment of the crowd assembled near the post to witness the struggle
described above.<a class="noteref" id="n171.5src" href="#n171.5" name=
"n171.5src">53</a></p>
<p>Sometimes contests are held between two parties of boys in singing
vulgar songs. The contest commences by one of the parties singing a
song. The other party responds to it by singing another song, which is
generally more indecent than the song sung first. The contest goes on
like this, and the party which fails to respond to its rival is said to
be defeated.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n171.5">53</a></p>
<p>The immoral practices described above are only to be seen among low
caste people, and even their women take part in these practices.</p>
<p>The women of higher castes wear rich clothes and ornaments on the
<i>Dhuleti</i> day, and sing songs in their houses. At times they throw
coloured water and red powder at each other.<a class="noteref" id=
"n171.6src" href="#n171.6" name="n171.6src">54</a></p>
<p>In big temples a festivity called <i>Ful Dol</i> is observed, in
which water coloured with the flowers of the <i>Kh&#257;khra</i>
(<span lang="la">Butea frondosa</span>) is thrown by the party
assembled, and <i>kundali&#257;s</i> or indecent songs are sung in a
loud voice.<a class="noteref" id="n171.7src" href="#n171.7" name=
"n171.7src">55</a></p>
<p>In some temples, holy songs are sung at night and prayers are held.
At the end, fried <i>juv&#257;ri</i>, gram and sweets are distributed
as the grace of God.<a class="noteref" id="n171.8src" href="#n171.8"
name="n171.8src">56</a></p>
<p>The boys who take an active part in the <i>Holi</i> celebrations are
known as <i>geraiy&#257;s</i> or <i>holi&#257;s</i>. For two or three
nights before the <i>Holi</i> they steal fuel for the <i>Holi</i> fire
and beat and abuse <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e19049" href=
"#xd26e19049" name="xd26e19049">172</a>]</span>those who try to prevent
them from so doing. They also recite coarse songs and play with dirt
and mud freely. Parties of them go from shop to shop and obtain by
force dates and fried gram.<a class="noteref" id="n172.1src" href=
"#n172.1" name="n172.1src">57</a></p>
<p>At midnight of the <i>Holi</i> day a bower is erected in the centre
of the village with bits of broken earthen vessels and cocoanut shells.
A fool, generally a son-in-law of some low caste Hindu in the village,
is induced, by the promise of dates and cocoanut kernel, to dress in a
coat on which are drawn naked pictures. A garland of worn out shoes is
tied round his neck and he is mounted on a donkey. He is then called
<i>V&#257;lam</i> and taken from the bower through the village
accompanied with music and crowds of people, who utter in a loud voice
coarse and vulgar expressions as the procession moves on. At times they
play jokes with the <i>V&#257;lam</i>, and give him blows on the head
with their fists.<a class="noteref" id="n172.2src" href="#n172.2" name=
"n172.2src">58</a></p>
<p>In some places, this procession is called <i>V&#257;lama
V&#257;lami</i> and is celebrated on the night preceding the
<i>Holi</i>. Two poor stupid persons are dressed as bride and
bridegroom, the latter in a ridiculously grotesque dress. They are
married on the following morning, when vulgar songs are sung. The
<i>V&#257;lam</i> and <i>V&#257;lami</i> are represented by two naked
idols, made of rags, of a man and a woman. They are carried through the
village in a noisy procession and married on an altar of black earthen
vessels. They are then placed erect on two wooden posts side be
side.<a class="noteref" id="n172.3src" href="#n172.3" name=
"n172.3src">59</a></p>
<p>In some villages, a large stone is placed in a spacious compound in
the centre of the village, and broken earthen vessels are suspended
over it with cords from the wooden bower erected over the stone. An ass
is brought to the spot, and a fool decked with a garland of worn out
shoes is mounted on it with his face turned towards the tail of the
ass. He holds the tail of the ass in his hands as reins and is carried
in procession through the village to be brought back to the bower and
married to another fool, dust, ashes and water being freely used in the
service.<a class="noteref" id="n172.4src" href="#n172.4" name=
"n172.4src">60</a></p>
<p>In some localities naked images of a husband and wife are set in a
cart and taken through the village accompanied with music, the crowd
singing indecent songs all the way long.<a class="noteref" id=
"n172.5src" href="#n172.5" name="n172.5src">61</a></p>
<p>On the <i>Holi</i> holiday children are presented with <i>harda</i>
(garlands of balls made of sugar) by their relatives and the friends of
their families.<a class="noteref" id="n172.6src" href="#n172.6" name=
"n172.6src">62</a></p>
<p>The <i>Holi</i> fire is extinguished by women on the morning of the
following day. The earthen vessels containing wheat and gram which are
put into the pit of the <i>Holi</i> before the fire is lighted are then
taken out. The grain is cooked by the fire of <i>Holi</i>, and is
called <i>Ghugari</i>. It is distributed among the villagers, the
belief being that those who eat it are protected against disease by the
goddess of the <i>Holi</i>.<a class="noteref" id="n172.7src" href=
"#n172.7" name="n172.7src">63</a></p>
<p>There are many other superstitious beliefs held by people in
connection with the <i>Holi</i>.</p>
<p>According to one belief, those who expose themselves to the heat of
the <i>Holi</i> fire keep good health during the ensuing year.
According to some, this can be secured by eating sugar-cane heated over
the fire. <i>Juv&#257;ri</i> stems heated over the fire are given to
cattle with the same object.<a class="noteref" id="n172.8src" href=
"#n172.8" name="n172.8src">64</a></p>
<p>Some believe that if salt heated over the <i>Holi</i> fire is given
to cattle it protects them against epidemics.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n172.8">64</a></p>
<p>Virgins take home a little of the <i>Holi</i> fire and light five
cow-dung cakes with it in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e19158"
href="#xd26e19158" name="xd26e19158">173</a>]</span>courtyard of their
house. When the cakes are burnt, the ashes are removed and the spot is
purified with a plaster of cow-dung. Next, they draw some auspicious
figures on the spot and worship them for a number of days in the belief
that this ensures good health to their brothers.<a class="noteref" id=
"n173.1src" href="#n173.1" name="n173.1src">65</a></p>
<p>Among Gujar&#257;t Hindus no special ceremonies are performed when a
girl attains puberty, except that on the third or fifth day she is
bathed by an unwidowed woman and dressed in green or saffron-coloured
robes. She is given rice in milk, sweetened with sugar, and is
presented with a piece of green satin.<a class="noteref" id="n173.2src"
href="#n173.2" name="n173.2src">66</a></p>
<p>In some places, the girl is bathed on the fourth day and given
<i>kans&#257;r</i> to eat. She then bows to her mother-in-law and makes
her a present of half a rupee. The mother-in-law blesses her and
presents her with a bodice cloth.<a class="noteref" id="n173.3src"
href="#n173.3" name="n173.3src">67</a></p>
<p>After the bath, a mark with red powder is made on her forehead and
she is taken to the temple of the family deity.<a class="noteref" id=
"n173.4src" href="#n173.4" name="n173.4src">68</a></p>
<p>In some places, the red powder mark is made under the girl&rsquo;s
right arm in the belief that this ensures to her the birth of many
children.<a class="noteref" id="n173.5src" href="#n173.5" name=
"n173.5src">69</a></p>
<p>In some localities the girl is bathed on the third day, dainty
dishes are served her, and she is presented with a cocoanut by each of
her kinsfolk<span class="corr" id="xd26e19191" title=
"Not in source">.</span><a class="noteref" id="n173.6src" href=
"#n173.6" name="n173.6src">70</a></p>
<p>In some castes, when a girl attains puberty, a feast of cooked rice
and molasses is given to the caste people. In other castes, pieces of
cocoanut kernel are distributed among children, and the girl is
presented with a robe and bodice by her parents-in-law.<a class=
"noteref" id="n173.7src" href="#n173.7" name="n173.7src">71</a></p>
<p>In some castes, a girl is not allowed to cook before she attains
puberty.<a class="noteref" id="n173.8src" href="#n173.8" name=
"n173.8src">72</a></p>
<p>No ceremonies are performed when a boy attains puberty, probably
because in the case of boys the change is not so marked as in the case
of girls.</p>
