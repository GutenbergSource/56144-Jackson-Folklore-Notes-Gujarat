<docDate>1914</docDate></docImprint></titlePage><pb n="5"/><div1 id="intro" type="Introduction"><head>INTRODUCTION.</head><p>The circumstances attending the murder of Mr. A. M. T. Jackson in Nasik in December 1909 led to the raising of a small subscription among his friends, to be devoted to a memorial in some shape or form, showing the respect and affection with which he was regarded in Western India. A large part of the fund then raised was expended on the purchase of his valuable library, which now forms a part of the collection owned by the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. It was subsequently decided that the balance could not be better spent than in defraying the cost of publishing certain folklore materials which he had collected and intended, at the time of his untimely death, to publish in the pages of the <hi>Indian Antiquary</hi>. These materials were the result of an enquiry set on foot by him about the year 1900. His plan of operation was to forward, through the agency of the Education Department, Crooke&#8217;s list of folklore questions to schoolmasters in various parts of the Presidency. The question paper is given below; the replies form the raw material from which these notes have been compiled. For convenience they are divided into two series: Gujarat and the Konkan.
</p><p>I desire at the outset of these introductory remarks to explain that, when at the request of the memorial committee I undertook the task of seeing these notes through the press, I did not contemplate any critical handling of the materials found in the papers made over to me. I had neither the leisure nor the knowledge to carry out Mr. Jackson&#8217;s intention, <hi>i.e.</hi>, to edit the notes carefully with such criticisms and comparisons as his ripe scholarship would have suggested. I make no claim, therefore, to have effected more than to have rescued from the wastepaper basket a number of replies to questions regarding the beliefs of the people in Gujarat and the Konkan. The notes as now presented doubtless contain much that is trivial, and possibly many inaccuracies; but among them students of folklore may on the other hand discover material of real value&#8212;such as they are, they will, I trust, repay careful study, and perhaps serve one day to form the basis of a further and more comprehensive examination of the folk-lore of the Bombay Presidency&#8212;an examination which should not be too long deferred, for the old practices and beliefs are yearly tending to decay and vanish in contact with the spread of education. The field for enquiry is wide and rich, but workers fail to come forward; and meanwhile the old beliefs and practices slowly disappear. On the subjects with which these notes deal, much information of value has already been collected and recorded by another oriental scholar, the late Sir James Campbell, K.C.I.E., and will be found partly in the pages of the Bombay Gazetteer, and partly in the notes on the Spirit Basis of Belief and Custom which he published from time to time in the <hi>Indian Antiquary</hi>. The present notes carry striking confirmation of Sir James Campbell&#8217;s theory regarding the extent to which beliefs and religious practices in this country can be traced to the desire to propitiate <pb n="6"/>spirit presences. It may be remarked that Campbell&#8217;s work in the domain of Indian folk-lore does not seem to have received the notice that it deserves in the works of writers on folk-lore generally, possibly because so much of it is buried in the pages of the Bombay Gazetteer or in scattered numbers of the <hi>Indian Antiquary</hi>. The notes would amply repay the labour of republication, with a summary and suitable index. They deal very fully with spirit worship and possession, witchcraft and magic, and the evil eye. They differ from the present notes in being to a large extent comparative, assembling under the various heads of ancestor worship, spirit haunts, spirit possession, exorcism, etc., kindred beliefs from all parts of the world. Doubtless his work to no small extent suggested to Mr. Jackson the line of enquiry which is contained in the question paper. From the materials accumulated by these two scholars a comprehensive study of the folk-lore of western India may one day be compiled.
</p><p>The notes illustrate very fully the common beliefs in unseen presences causing mischief of various kinds. They illustrate the common methods of protection by propitiation, of spirit and disease scaring, and of avoidance of the effects of the evil eye. A full list will be found (pp. 126&#8211;130) of the lucky and unlucky omens besetting the undertaking of various acts, and much information is recorded regarding lucky and unlucky numbers, and spirit scaring names which has not, so far as I am aware, been made public before. Ceremonies for exorcising spirits that have possessed human beings are given in some detail. There will also be found an account of the interpretation commonly put on such natural phenomena as the rainbow, an eclipse, thunder, lightning, meteors, comets, &amp;c.
</p><p>Many examples are given of the beliefs regarding the means for securing successful pregnancy. The trees and animals worshipped in the country side are described, with the ceremony that is held to be suitable in each case. An unusually interesting belief is that which attributes to a certain lake in Gujarat the power to transform males into females and vice versa (see p. 39). The curing of diseases by the wearing of magic threads and the application of <hi>mantras</hi> or holy verses is also dealt with in some detail. Finally a list is given of the shrines of the country side with the tradition regarding the holy man in whose honour and to whose memory they have been erected. They are for the most part worshipped alike by Hindu and Musalman.
</p><p>In conclusion, I would refer once more to the fact that no attempt has been made to edit critically the information embodied in these notes. In the scanty leisure available after official demands on my time have been met, it has only been possible to see the materials through the press as they stood, after translation. The task has been greatly lightened by the generous assistance received from R. B. P. B. Joshi who undertook the preparation of the whole of the MSS. of the Konkan series. I am also greatly indebted to Mr. G. M. Kalelkar for many arduous hours of work on the compilation of the Gujarat papers. To both these gentlemen my cordial thanks are due for their co-operation. If the publication of these materials serve to stimulate interest in the subject of Indian folk-lore, they will not have been printed in vain. Such as they are, they will, I trust<corr>,</corr> remain as a small tribute to the memory of an oriental scholar, of no mean merit, of whose services India was deprived in so untimely a manner.

The principle underlying the whole fabric of the worship of these minor deities, who for the most part are the spirits of dead ancestors or heroes, has more in it of fear for their power of harming than of love for their divine nature. All untoward occurrences in domestic affairs, all bodily ailments and unusual natural phenomena, inexplicable to the simple mind of the villager, are attributed to the malignant action of these nameless and numerous spirits, hovering over and haunting the habitations of men.<note id="n15.1" n="1">Khan Bahadur Fazlullah and Mr. K. D. Desai.</note> The latent dread of receiving injuries from these evil spirits results in the worship by the low-class people of a number of <hi>devas</hi> and <hi>m&#257;t&#257;s</hi>, as they are called. The poor villager, surrounded on all sides by hosts of hovering spirits, ready to take offence, or even to possess him, on the smallest pretext, requires some tangible protector to save him from such malign influences.<ref type="noteref" target="n15.1">[#1]</ref> He sets up and enshrines the spirit that he believes to have been beneficent to him, and so deserving of worship, and makes vows in its honour, often becoming himself the officiating priest. Each such deity has its own particular <hi>th&#257;nak</hi> (<hi>sth&#257;na</hi>) or locality. Thus there is hardly a village which has not a particular deity of its own. But in addition to this deity, others in far off villages are generally held in high esteem.<ref type="noteref" target="n15.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>There are a number of ways in which these lower-class deities can be installed. Their images are made either of wood, stone, or metal.<note id="n15.2" n="2">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Schoolmaster, Dhhank.</note> No temples or shrines are erected in their honour.<note id="n15.3" n="3">The Deputy Educational Inspector, Gohelwad.</note> An ordinary way of representing them is by drawing a trident, (<hi>trish&#363;l</hi>, a weapon peculiar to god Shiva) in <corr sic="red lead">red-lead</corr> and oil on an upright slab of stone on a public road, on any dead wall, on the confines of a village, or a mountain side, or a hill top, in an underground cellar, or on the bank of a stream.<note id="n15.4" n="4">Mr. N. D. Vora, Schoolmaster, Rajpara.</note> Some people paint tridents in their own houses. The <hi>trish&#363;l</hi>, or trident, may also be made of wood, in which case its three points are plastered with red-lead and oil and covered with a thin coating of tin.<note id="n15.5" n="5">The Deputy Educational Inspector, Gohelwad.</note> Sometimes carved wooden images in human shape, daubed over with red-lead and oil, are placed in a small wooden chariot or in a recess about a foot square. In some shrines two brooms or whisks of peacock&#8217;s feathers are placed on either side of the image.<note id="n15.6" n="6">Mr. M. D. Vyas, Shastri, Bhayavadur.</note> A slight difficulty overcome or a disease remedied by a vow in honour of any of these deities offers the occasion for an installation, and in all future emergencies of the same kind similar vows are observed. A <hi>m&#257;t&#257;</hi> installed to protect a fortress or a street is called a Gadheri M&#257;t&#257;, and the worshippers of a fortress, or street, mother are known as Pothias.<note id="n15.7" n="7">Mr. K. P. Joshi, Schoolmaster, Limbdi.</note> At the time of installation flags are hoisted near the dedicated places. A troop of dancers with jingling anklets recite holy verses, while the <hi>bhuva</hi>, exorcist-priest, performs the ceremonies. Generally installations are frequent during the <pb n="16"/>Navar&#257;tra<note id="n16.a" n="A">The first nine days of &#256;shvin, the last month of the Gujarat Hindu Calendar, known otherwise as M&#257;t&#257;n&#257; d&#257;had&#257;-m&#257;t&#257;&#8217;s days. The influence of the m&#257;t&#257;s is very strong in these days.</note> holidays when, if no human-shaped image is set up, a <hi>trish&#363;l</hi> at least is drawn in red-lead and oil.<note id="n16.1" n="1">Mr. K. D. Desai.</note> Some of these evil deities require, at the time of their installation, the <hi>balid&#257;n</hi> (sacrifice or oblation) of a goat or a he-buffalo. Also, when a spirit is to be exorcised, the symbol of the familiar spirit of the exorcist is set up and invoked by him.<ref type="noteref" target="n16.1">[#1]</ref> After the installation, no systematic form of worship is followed in connection with them.<note id="n16.2" n="2">Mr. M. D. Vayas, Shastri, Bhayavadur.</note> Regular forms are prescribed for the <hi>real</hi> gods of the Pur&#257;nas. But upon these the low-caste people are not authorised to attend.
</p><p>Still, in practice there are two forms of worship: ordinary or <hi>s&#257;m&#257;nya-p&#363;j&#257;</hi> and special or <hi>vishesha-p&#363;j&#257;</hi>.<note id="n16.3" n="3">The Deputy Educational Inspector, Gohelwad.</note> Ordinary worship is performed by bathing the deity&#8212;which can be done by sprinkling a few drops of water over it&#8212;burning a ghi, or an oil, lamp before it, and by offering a cocoanut and a pice or a half-anna piece. The last is taken away by the <hi>bhuva</hi>, or priest, who returns generally half or three-quarters of the cocoanut as a <hi>pras&#257;d</hi> of the god.
</p><p>There are no particular days prescribed for such worship, but Sundays and Tuesdays would seem to be the most favoured.<note id="n16.4" n="4">Mr. K. D. Desai.</note> On such days, offerings are made for the fulfilment of a vow recorded in order to avoid a <hi>b&#257;dh&#257;</hi>, or impending evil. In the observance of this vow the devotee abstains from certain things, such as ghi, butter, milk, rice, juvar, betelnut till the period of the vow expires. When a vow is thus discharged, the devotee offers flowers, garlands, incense, food or drink according to the terms of his vow.<ref type="noteref" target="n16.4">[#4]</ref> The <hi>dh&#363;pa</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, burning incense of <hi>g&#363;gal</hi> (balsamodendron) is one of the commonest methods of worship.
</p><p>The days for special worship are the Navar&#257;tra holidays, the second day of the bright half of &#256;sh&#257;dh, the ninth month of the Hindu Calendar,<note id="n16.5" n="5">Mr. N. D. Vora, Schoolmaster, Rajpara.</note> Div&#257;s&#257;<note id="n16.6" n="6">Mr. B. K. Dave, Schoolmaster, Kotda-Sangani.</note> or the fifteenth day of the dark half of &#256;sh&#257;dh, and K&#257;l&#299;-chaudas<note id="n16.7" n="7">Mr. N. D. Vora, Schoolmaster, Rajpara.</note> or the fourteenth day of the dark half of &#256;shvin, the last month; besides other extraordinary occasions when a spirit has to be exorcised out of a sick person.
</p><p>The Navar&#257;tra days are said to be the most auspicious days for dev&#299;-worship. People believing in the power of the m&#257;t&#257;s observe fast on these days. Most of them at least fast on the eighth day of the Navar&#257;tra known as M&#257;t&#257;-ashtam&#299;, taking only a light meal which consists of roots, as a rule, especially the suran (<foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">Amorphophallus campanulatus</foreign>), and of dates and milk.<note id="n16.8" n="8">Mr. K. D. Desai.</note> On the Navar&#257;tra days red-lead and oil are applied to the images of the devis, and a number of oblations, such as loaves, cooked rice, <hi>l&#257;psi</hi><note id="n16.b" n="B"><hi><corr sic="Lapsi">L&#257;psi</corr></hi> is coarse wheat-flour fried in ghi and sweetened with molasses or sugar.</note>, <hi>vad&#257;n</hi><note id="n16.c" n="C">Vad&#257;n-bean flour&#8212;generally of gram or peas&#8212;is allowed to remain in water with spices until the paste acquires a sufficient degree of consistence, when it is rolled into small biscuit-sized balls and fried in oil.</note> and <hi>b&#257;kl&#257;</hi><note id="n16.d" n="D"><hi>B&#257;kl&#257;</hi> are small round flat cakes of dry boiled beans.</note> are offered.<note id="n16.9" n="9">Mr. N. D. Vora, Schoolmaster, Rajpara.</note> The utmost ceremonial cleanliness is observed in the preparation of these viands. The corn is sifted, cleaned, ground or pounded, cooked, treated with frankincense, offered to the gods and lastly partaken of before sunset, and all these operations must be performed on the same day; for the offerings must not see lamp-light.<note id="n16.10" n="10">Mr. N. M. Dave, Schoolmaster, S&#257;nk&#257;.</note> Girls are not allowed to partake of these offerings. All ceremonies should be conducted with much earnestness and reverence; otherwise the offerings will fail to prove acceptable to the m&#257;t&#257;s or devis.<ref type="noteref" target="n16.10">[#10]</ref>
</p><p>On M&#257;t&#257;-ashtam&#299; and K&#257;l&#299;-chaudas devotees sometimes offer rams, goats or buffaloes as victims to the devis or devas in addition to the usual offerings of <hi>l&#257;psi</hi>, <hi>vad&#257;n</hi> and <hi>b&#257;kl&#257;</hi>.<ref type="noteref" target="n16.10">[#10]</ref> The night of K&#257;l&#299;-chaudas is believed to be so favourable for the efficacious <pb n="17"/>recitation (<hi>s&#257;dhana</hi>) of certain <hi>mantras</hi>, mysterious incantations possessing sway over spirits, that <hi>bhuvas</hi> (exorcists) leave the village and sit up performing certain rites in <corr sic="cometeries">cemeteries</corr>, on burning-ghats, and in other equally suitable places where spirits are supposed to congregate.<note id="n17.1" n="1">Mr. N. M. Dave, Schoolmaster, Sanka.</note>
</p><p>On Div&#257;s&#257;, the last day of &#256;sh&#257;dh, the ninth month, low-caste people bathe their gods with water and milk, besmear them with red-lead and oil, and make offerings of cocoanuts, <hi>l&#257;psi</hi>, <hi>b&#257;kl&#257;</hi> of <hi>ad&#257;d</hi> (<corr sic="Phansolens">Phaseoleus</corr> radiatus) or <hi>kans&#257;r</hi><note id="n17.a" n="A">Kans&#257;r is coarse wheat-flour cooked in three times as much water, sweetened with molasses or sugar, and taken with ghi.&#8212;B. L. Dave, Schoolmaster, Kotda-Sangani.</note>. Particular offerings are believed to be favoured by particular deities: for instance, <hi>khichdo</hi> (rice and pulse boiled together) and oil, or <hi>tavo</hi> (flat unleavened loaves) are favoured by the goddess Meldi, boiled rice by Shikotar and <hi>l&#257;psi</hi> by the goddess G&#257;tr&#257;d.<note id="n17.2" n="2">The Deputy Educational Inspector, Gohelwad.</note>
</p><p>On these holidays, as well as on the second day of the bright half of &#256;sh&#257;dh the devotees hoist flags in honour of the spirits, and play on certain musical instruments producing discordant sounds. Meanwhile <hi>bhuvas</hi>, believed to be interpreters of the wills of evil spirits, undergo self-torture, with the firm conviction that the spirits have entered their persons. Sometimes they lash themselves with iron chains or cotton braided scourges.<note id="n17.3" n="3">Mr. G. K. Dave, Schoolmaster, Sultanpore.</note> At times a <hi>bhuva</hi> places a pan-full of sweet oil over a fire till it boils. He then fries cakes in it, and takes them out with his unprotected hands, sprinkling the boiling oil over his hair. He further dips thick cotton wicks into the oil, lights them and puts them into his mouth and throws red-hot bullets into his mouth, seemingly without any injury.<note id="n17.4" n="4">Mr. N. D. Vora, Schoolmaster, Rajpara.</note> This process secures the confidence of the <hi>sevakas</hi> or followers, and is very often used by <hi>bhuvas</hi> when exorcising spirits from persons whose confidence the <hi>bhuvas</hi> wish to gain. A bowl-full of water is then passed round the head of the ailing person (or animal) to be charmed, and the contents are swallowed by the exorcist to show that he has swallowed in the water all the ills the flesh of the patient is heir to.<ref type="noteref" target="n17.4">[#4]</ref>
</p><p>In the cure of certain diseases by exorcising the process known as <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> is sometimes gone through. An <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> is a sacrificial offering of the nature of a scapegoat, and consists of a black earthen vessel, open and broad at the top, and containing <hi>l&#257;psi</hi>, <hi>vad&#257;n</hi>, <hi>b&#257;kl&#257;</hi>, a yard of <hi>atlas</hi> (dark-red silk fabric), one rupee and four annas in cash, pieces of charcoal, red-lead, <hi>sorro</hi> (or surmo-lead ore used as eye-powder), an iron-nail and three cocoanuts.<ref type="noteref" target="n17.4">[#4]</ref> Very often a trident is drawn in red-lead and oil on the outer sides of the black earthen vessel.<note id="n17.5" n="5">Mr. B. K. Dave, Schoolmaster, Kotda-Sangani.</note> The <hi>bhuva</hi> carries the <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> in his hands with a drawn sword in a procession, to the noise of the jingling of the anklets of his companions, the beating of drums and the rattling of cymbals. After placing the <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> in the cemetery the procession returns with tumultuous shouts of joy and much jingling of anklets.<note id="n17.6" n="6">Mr. N. D. Vora, Schoolmaster, Rajpara.</note>
</p><p>Sometimes <hi>bhuvas</hi> are summoned for two or three nights preceding the day of the <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> ceremony, and a ceremony known as <hi>D&#257;nkl&#257;n-besw&#257;n</hi> or the installation of the <hi>d&#257;nkl&#257;</hi><note id="n17.7" n="7">Mr. Girijashankar Karunashankar, Schoolmaster, Songadh.</note> is performed. (A <hi>d&#257;nkl&#257;</hi><note id="n17.b" n="B">A <hi>d&#257;nkl&#257;</hi> is otherwise known by the name of <hi>d&#363;g-dudioon</hi>.</note> is a special spirit instrument in the shape of a small kettle-drum producing, when beaten by a stick, a most discordant, and, by long association, a melancholy, gruesome and ghastly sound&#8212;K. B. Fazlullah).
</p><p>Many sects have special deities of their own, attended upon by a <hi>bhuva</hi> of the same order.<note id="n17.8" n="8">Mr. Jagannath Hirji, Schoolmaster, Chok.</note> The <hi>bhuva</hi> holds a high position in the society of his caste-fellows. He believes himself to be possessed by the devi or m&#257;t&#257; whose attendant he is, and declares, <pb n="18"/>while possessed by her, the will of the m&#257;t&#257;, replying for her to such questions as may be put to him.<note id="n18.1" n="1">Mr. Jethabhai Mangaldas, Schoolmaster, Gondal.</note> The devis are supposed to appear in specially favoured <hi>bhuvas</hi> and to endow them with prophetic powers.<note id="n18.2" n="2">Mr. Nandlal Kalidas, Schoolmaster, Chhatr&#257;s&#257;.</note>
</p><p>The following is a list of some of the inferior local deities of Gujarat and Kathiawar:&#8212;
</p><p>(1) Suro-p&#363;ro.&#8212;This is generally the spirit of some brave ancestor who died a heroic death, and is worshipped by his descendants as a family-god at his birthplace as well as at the scene of his death, where a pillar (<hi>p&#257;lio</hi>) is erected to his memory.<note id="n18.3" n="3">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Schoolmaster, Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>(2) Vachhro, otherwise known by the name of D&#257;d&#257; (sire).&#8212;This is said to have been a Rajput, killed in rescuing the cowherds of some Ch&#257;rans, who invoked his aid, from a party of free-booters.<note id="n18.4" n="4">Mr. H. R. Pandya, Schoolmaster, Khirasar&#257;.</note> He is considered to be the family-god of the Ahirs of Solanki descent, and is the sole village-deity in Okha and Baradi Districts.<note id="n18.5" n="5">Mr. L. G. Travadi, Schoolmaster, Upleta.</note> Other places dedicated to this god are Pad&#257;n&#257;, Ani&#257;l&#257;, Taluka Mengani,<note id="n18.6" n="6">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Schoolmaster, Dhhank.</note> Khajurdi, Khirasar&#257; and Anida.<note id="n18.7" n="7">Mr. H. R. Pandya, Schoolmaster, Khirasar&#257;.</note> He is represented by a stone horse, and Ch&#257;rans perform priestly duties in front of him.<note id="n18.8" n="8">Mr. L. G. Travadi, Schoolmaster, Upleta.</note> Submission to, and vows in honour of, this god, are believed to cure rabid-dog-bites.<note id="n18.9" n="9">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Schoolmaster, Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>(3) Sarm&#257;lio commands worship in Gondal, Khokh&#257;ri and many other places. Newly-married couples of many castes loosen the knots tied in their marriage-scarves as a mark of respect for him.<note id="n18.a" n="A">Two pieces of cloth, a shouldercloth and a scarf are cast over the bridegroom and the bride, and they are tied together by a knot. It is the unloosing of this tie which is here referred to.&#8212;Mr. K. D. Desai.</note> Persons bitten by a snake wear round their necks a piece of thread dedicated to this god.<ref type="noteref" target="n18.9">[#9]</ref>
</p><p>(4) <corr sic="Sh&#299;tal&#257;">Shital&#257;</corr> is a goddess known for the cure of small-pox.&#8212;Persons attacked by this disease observe vows in her honour. K&#257;l&#257;vad and Sy&#257;dl&#257; are places dedicated to her.<ref type="noteref" target="n18.9">[#9]</ref>
</p><p>(5) Gan&#257;gor.&#8212;Virgins who are anxious to secure suitable husbands and comfortable establishments worship this goddess and observe vows in her honour.<ref type="noteref" target="n18.9">[#9]</ref>
</p><p>(6) Tod&#257;li&#257;<corr>.</corr>&#8212;She has neither an idol nor a temple set up in her honour, but is represented by a heap of stones lying on the village boundary&#8212;P&#257;dal or J&#257;mp&#257;. All marriage processions, before entering the village (S&#257;nk&#257;) or passing by the heap, pay homage to this deity and offer a cocoanut, failure to do which is believed to arouse her wrath. She does not command daily adoration, but on occasions the attendant, who is a Chumv&#257;li&#257; Koli, and who appropriates all the presents to this deity, burns frankincense of <hi>gugal</hi> (balsamodendron) and lights a lamp before her.<note id="n18.10" n="10">Mr. N. M. Dave, Schoolmaster, S&#257;nk&#257;.</note>
</p><p>(7) Butt&#257;ya also is represented by a heap of stones on a hillock in the vicinity of S&#257;nk&#257;. Her worshipper is a Talabdia Koli. A long season of drought leads to her propitiation by feasting Br&#257;hmans, for which purpose four pounds of corn are taken in her name from each threshing floor in the village.<ref type="noteref" target="n18.10">[#10]</ref>
</p><p>(8) Surdhan.&#8212;This seems to have been some brave Kshatriya warrior who died on a battlefield. A temple is erected to his memory, containing an image of Shiva. The attending priest is an Atit.<ref type="noteref" target="n18.10">[#10]</ref>
</p><p>(9) Ghogho.&#8212;This is a cobra-god worshipped in the village of Bikhijada having a Bajana (tumbler) for his attending priest.<ref type="noteref" target="n18.10">[#10]</ref>
</p><p>(10) Pir.&#8212;This is a Musalman saint, in whose honour no tomb is erected, the special site alone being worshipped by a devotee.<ref type="noteref" target="n18.10">[#10]</ref>
</p><p>(11) Raneki is represented by a heap of stones, and is attended upon by <hi>cham&#257;rs</hi> (tanners). Her favourite resort is near the Dhedv&#257;d&#257; (<hi>i.e.</hi>, a quarter inhabited by sweepers). A childless Girasia is said to <pb n="19"/>have observed a vow in her honour for a son, and a son being born to him, he dedicated certain lands to her; but they are no longer in the possession of the attendants.<note id="n19.1" n="1">Mr. N. M. Dave, Schoolmaster, S&#257;nk&#257;.</note>
</p><p>(12) Hanuman.&#8212;On a mound of earth there is an old worn-out image of this god. People sometimes light a lamp there, offer cocoanuts and plaster the image with red-lead and oil. A <hi>s&#257;dhu</hi> of the M&#257;ragi sect, a Koli by birth, acts as <hi>pujari</hi>.<ref type="noteref" target="n19.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>(13) Shakt&#257; (or shakti).&#8212;This is a Girasia goddess attended upon by a Chumv&#257;li&#257; Koli. On the Navar&#257;tra days, as well as on the following day, Girasias worship this goddess, and if necessary observe vows in her name.<ref type="noteref" target="n19.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>(14) Harsidh.&#8212;G&#257;ndhavi in Bard&#257; and Ujjain are the places dedicated to this goddess. There is a tradition connected with her that her image stood in a place of worship facing the sea on Mount Koyalo in Gandhavi. She was believed to sink or swallow all the vessels that sailed by. A Bania named Jagadus&#257;, knowing this, propitiated her by the performance of religious austerities. On being asked what boon he wanted from her, he requested her to descend from her mountain-seat. She agreed on the Bania promising to offer a living victim for every footstep she took in descending. Thus he sacrificed one victim after another until the number of victims he had brought was exhausted. He then first offered his four or five children, then his wife and lastly himself. In reward for his self-devotion the goddess faced towards Miani and no mishaps are believed to take place in the village.<note id="n19.2" n="2">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Schoolmaster, Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>(15) Hinglaj.&#8212;This goddess has a place of worship a hundred and fifty miles from Karachi in Sind, to which her devotees and believers make pilgrimage.<ref type="noteref" target="n19.2">[#2]</ref>
</p><p>In the village of J&#257;sd&#257;n, in Kathiawar, there is an ancient shrine of K&#257;lu-P&#299;r in whose memory there are two sepulchres covered with costly fabrics, and a large flag floats over the building. Both Hindus and Musalmans believe<note id="n19.a" n="A">The tendency to fraternise as much in belief as in nationality is a notable feature of Indian life. The saying goes:&#8212;Hindu Musalm&#257;n &#233;k R&#257;m bij&#243; Rehm&#257;n. The Hindu and Musalman are not far apart; one is the follower of R&#257;m, the other of Rehm&#257;n (the most compassionate&#8212;a Kuranic name of Allah). Again says another proverb: The Hindu and Musalm&#257;n are as closely connected as the breast and the skirt of a garment (Hindu n&#233; Musalm&#257;n moli d&#257;man jo vehev&#257;r). The Hindu pays homage to the P&#299;r, the Muslim repays the compliment by holding some of his Hindu brother&#8217;s lower class deities, such as Vaital and K&#257;li and Amb&#257;, in awe. The Hindu worships and breaks cocoanuts before the Moharram <hi>taazias</hi>&#8212;the Musalman responds by showing a sneaking sort of a regard for the Holi, whom he believes to have been a daughter of the patriarch Abraham. This reciprocal good fellowship in <corr sic="time">times</corr> of political agitation, like those of the Indian Mutiny, results in the &#8220;chapati&#8221;, or unleavened bread loaf, being considered a symbol to be honoured both by Muslim and Hindu; and in more recent times, as during the plague troubles in Allahabad and Cawnpore, shows itself in the Muslim garlanding the Hindu on a holiday, and the Hindus setting up sherbat-stalls for Musalmans on an Id day.&#8212;Khan Bahadur Fazlullah.</note> in this saint, and offer cocoanuts, sweetmeats and money to his soul.

</p><p>The sun, the beneficent night-dispelling, light-bestowing great luminary, is believed to be the visible manifestation of the Almighty God,<note id="n20.5" n="5">Mr. D. K.

</p><p>He is the chief rain-sender<note id="n20.7" n="7">Mr. M. D. Vyas, Schoolmaster, Bhayavadur.</note>; there is a couplet used in Gujarat illustrative of this belief. It runs:&#8212;&#8220;Oblations are cast into the Fire: the smoke carries the prayers to the sun; the Divine Luminary, propitiated, responds in sending down gentle showers.&#8221; &#8220;The sacred smoke, rising from the sacrificial offerings, ascends through the ethereal regions to the Sun. He transforms it into the rain-giving clouds, the rains produce food, and food produces the powers of generation and multiplication and plenty. Thus, the sun, as the propagator of animal life, is believed to be the highest deity.<ref type="noteref" target="n20.7">[#7]</ref>&#8221;
</p><p>It is pretty generally believed that vows in honour of the sun are highly efficacious in curing eye-diseases and strengthening the eyesight. Mr. Damodar Karsonji Pandya quotes from the Bhagvadg&#299;t&#257; the saying of Krishna:

</p><p>Women believe that a vow or a <hi>vrat</hi> made to the sun is the sure means of attaining their desires. Chiefly their vows are made with the object of securing a son. On the fulfilment of this desire, in gratitude to the Great Luminary, the child is often called after him, and given such a name as Suraj-R&#257;m, Bh&#257;nu-Shankar, Ravi-Shankar, Adit-R&#257;m.<note id="n20.11" n="11">Mr. N.

Unfortunate parents, who have lost many children, vow to grow the hair of their little children, if such are preserved to them, observing all the time a votive abstinence from a particular dish or betelnut or the like. When the children are 3 or 5 or 7 years old, the vow is fulfilled by taking them to a sacred place, like the temple of Ranchhodji at Dakor, to have their hair cut for the first time.

</p><p>In observing vows in the sun&#8217;s honour on Sundays, the following special foods are prescribed in particular months:<note id="n23.5" n="5">Mr. Nandlal Kalidas, Schoolmaster, Chhatrasa.</note>&#8212;
</p><p>(1) In K&#257;rtika, the first month, the devotee is to take only three leaves of the Tulsi or the holy basil plant.
</p><p>(2) In M&#257;rgash&#299;rsha, the devotee may only lick a few pieces of candied sugar.
</p><p>(3) In Pausha, the devotee may chew three stalks of green darbha grass.
</p><p>(4) In M&#257;gha, a few seeds of sesamum and sugar mixed together may be swallowed.
</p><p>(5) In Ph&#257;lguna, a consecrated draught of curds and sugar may be drunk.
</p><p>(6) In Chaitra, people should break their fasts with a little ghi and molasses.
</p><p>(7) In Vaish&#257;kha, the only satisfaction allowed to those observing the <hi>vrat</hi> is to lick their own palms three times.
</p><p>(8) In Jyeshtha, the fast is observed simply on three <hi>anjalis</hi> or palmfuls of pure water.
</p><p>(9) In Ash&#257;dha, three chillies may be eaten.
</p><p>(10) In Shr&#257;vana, only cow-urine and molasses are tasted.
</p><p>(11) In Bh&#257;drapada, cow-dung and sugar are partaken of.
</p><p>(12) In &#256;shvina, the application of chandan (sandal wood) either in the form of an ointment or of powder.
</p><p>Only a few very pious and enthusiastic devotees observe all Sundays in the above manner. In average cases, the devotee allows himself rice, ghi, sugar, milk, <hi>i.e.</hi>, white food, the restriction being only as to colour.<ref type="noteref" target="n23.5">[#5]</ref>
</p><p>People observing vows in honour of the sun take food only once during the day, and that too in <hi>b&#257;jas</hi> or dishes made of <hi>kh&#257;khara</hi> (or pal&#257;sh) leaves. This is considered one of the conditions of worship, there being some mysterious relation between S&#363;rya and the <hi>kh&#257;khara</hi>.<note id="n23.6" n="6">The Deputy Educational Inspector, Gohelwad.</note>
</p><p>If the Pushya Nakshatra happens to fall on a Sunday, the worship of the sun on that day is believed to be most efficacious in fulfilling the desires of the devotees.<note id="n23.7" n="7">Mr. D. K. Shah, Charadavah.</note>
</p><p>Of the days of the month, the seventh day of both the bright and the dark halves of each month<note id="n23.8" n="8">Mr. K. P.

The ceremonies of the worship are the same as those on Sundays. In fact, in almost all the observances in connection with the sun the same ceremonials are to be gone through. Very often a Brahman recites the p&#257;tha directing <pb n="24"/>his hosts or hostesses to perform certain ceremonial gestures. On the last of the number of days which the devotee has decided to observe, the <hi>vrat</hi> is celebrated and Brahmans are feasted. This celebration of the <hi>vrat</hi> is known as <hi>vratujavavun</hi>.<note id="n24.1" n="1">Mr. K. D. Desai.</note>
</p><p>The special occasions for Sun-worship are the Sankr&#257;nti days and the solar eclipses.
</p><p>In each year there are twelve Sankr&#257;nti days on which the sun moves from one sign of the zodiac to another.

</p><p>On solar eclipse days, most of the Hindu sects bathe and offer prayers to God. During the eclipse the sun is believed to be combating with the demon R&#257;hu, prayers being offered for the sun&#8217;s success. When the sun has freed himself from the grasp of the demon and sheds his full lustre on the earth, the people take ceremonial baths, offer prayers to God with a concentrated mind, and well-to-do people give in alms as much as they can afford of all kinds of grain.<note id="n24.7" n="7">Mr. M. M. Rana, Rajkot.</note>
</p><p>The Ch&#257;turm&#257;s-vrat, very common in Kathiawar, is a favourite one with Hindus. The devotee, in performing this <hi>vrat</hi>, abstains from food on those days during the monsoons on which, owing to cloudy weather, the sun is not visible. Even if the sun is concealed by the clouds for days together, the devout votary keeps fasting till he sees the deity again.<note id="n24.8" n="8">Mr. K. D. Desai.</note>
</p><p>Barren women, women whose children die, and especially those who lose their male children, women whose husbands suffer from diseases caused by heat, lepers, and persons suffering from ophthalmic ailments observe the vow of the sun in the following manner.<note id="n24.9" n="9">Mr. N. D. Vora, Schoolmaster, Rajpara.</note> The vows are kept on Sundays and Am&#257;v&#257;sy&#257; days, and the number of such days is determined by the devotee in accordance with the behests of a learned Brahman. The woman observes a fast on such days, bathes herself at noon when the sun reaches the zenith, and dresses herself in clean garments. Facing the sun, she dips twelve red karan flowers in red or white sandal ointment and recites the twelve names of S&#363;rya as she presents one flower after another to the sun with a bow.<note id="n24.b" n="B">The names are: 1 &#256;ditya, 2 Div&#257;kar, 3 Bh&#257;skar, 4 Prabh&#257;kar, 5 Sahasr&#257;nshu, 6 Trilochan, 7 Harit&#257;shva, 8 Vibh&#257;vasu, 9 Div&#257;krit, 10 Div&#257;darsh&#257;tmaka, 11 Trim&#363;rti, 12 S&#363;rya.</note> On each day of the <hi>vrat</hi>, she takes food only once, in the shape of <hi>l&#257;psi</hi>, in <hi>bajas</hi> of kh&#257;khar&#257; or pal&#257;sh leaves; white food in the form of rice, or rice cooked in milk is sometimes allowed.

</p><p>People who are declared by the Brahmans to be under the evil influence (dash&#257;) of S&#363;rya, observe vows in the sun&#8217;s honour and go through the prescribed rites on Sundays. Such persons take special kinds of food and engage the services of priests to recite <pb n="25"/>holy texts in honour of the sun. If all goes well on Sunday, Brahmans, S&#257;dhus and other pious persons are entertained at a feast. This feast is known as <hi>vrat-ujavavun</hi>.

The demon would not leave the womb of Subhadr&#257; even twelve months after the date of her conception, and began to harass the mother. Krishna, the incarnation of god, knowing of the demon&#8217;s presence and the cause of his delay, took pity on the afflicted condition of his sister and read chakr&#257;v&#257;, (Chakravy&#363;ha) a book consisting of seven chapters and explaining the method of conquering a labyrinthine fort with seven cross-lined forts. Krishna completed six chapters, and promised to teach the demon the seventh, provided he came out. The demon ceased troubling Subhadr&#257; and emerged from the womb. He was called Abhimanyu. Krishna never read the seventh chapter for then Abhimanyu would have been invincible and able to take his life. This ignorance of the seventh chapter cost Abhimanyu his life on the field of Kuru-kshetra in conquering the seven cross-lined labyrinthine forts. As the art of conquering a labyrinthine fort when taught to a demon in the womb facilitated the delivery of Subhadr&#257;, a belief spread that drinking in the figure of the seven cross-lined labyrinthine fort would facilitate the delivery of all women who had difficulties in child-birth.<ref type="noteref" target="n28.3">[#3]</ref>

</p><p>The figure <hi>Swastika</hi> (literally auspicious), drawn as shown below, is an auspicious sign, and is believed to be a mark of good luck and a source of blessings. It is one of the sixteen line-marks on the sole of the lotus-like feet of the god Ishwar, the Creator of the Universe.<note id="n28.4" n="4">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Schoolmaster, Dhhank.</note> The fame of the good effects of the Swastika figure is said to have been first diffused throughout society by N&#257;rad-Muni, as instructed by the god Brahma.<note id="n28.5" n="5">Mr. N. D. Vora, Schoolmaster, Rajpara.</note>
</p><p>Various conjectures have been made concerning the origin of this figure. The following explanation is found in a work named Siddh&#257;ntsar. The Eternal <hi>Sat</hi> or Essence, that has neither beginning nor end nor any maker, exhibits all the religious principles in a <hi>chakra</hi> or a wheel-form. This round shape has no circumference; but any point in it is a centre; which being specified, the explanation of the whole universe in a circle is easy. Thus the figure &#9737; indicates the creation of the universe from <hi>Sat</hi> or Essence. The centre with the circumference is the womb, the place of creation of the universe. The centre then expanding into a line, the diameter thus formed represents the male principle, <hi>linga-r&#363;p</hi>, that is the producer, through the medium of activity in the great womb or <hi>mah&#257;-yoni</hi>. When the line assumes the form of a cross, it explains the creation of the universe by an unprecedented combination of the two distinct natures, animate and inanimate. The circumference being <pb n="29"/>removed, the remaining cross represents the creation of the world. The Swastika, or Sathia, as it is sometimes called, in its winged form (&#21325;) suggests the possession of creative powers by the opposite natures, animate and inanimate.<note id="n29.1" n="1">Mr. N. J. Bhatt, Schoolmaster, Moti-Mur&#257;d.</note>
</p><p>Another theory is that an image of the eight-leaved lotus, springing from the navel of Vishnu, one of the Hindu Trinity, was formerly drawn on auspicious occasions as a sign of good luck. The exact imitation of the original being difficult, the latter assumed a variety of forms, one of which is the Swastika.<note id="n29.2" n="2">Mr. K. P. Joshi, Schoolmaster, Limbdi.</note>
</p><p>Some people see an image of the god Ganpati in the figure. That god being the master and protector of all auspicious ceremonies has to be invoked on all such occasions. The incapacity of the devotees to draw a faithful picture of Ganpati gave rise to a number of forms which came to be known by the name of Swastika.<note id="n29.3" n="3">Mr. H. R.

</p><p>There are more ways than one of drawing the Swastika, as shown below, but the original form was of the shape of a cross. The first consonant of the Gujarati alphabet, <hi>ka</hi>, now drawn thus &#2709;, was also originally drawn in the form of a cross (+). Some persons therefore suppose that the Swastika may be nothing more than the letter &#2709; (<hi>ka</hi>), written in the old style and standing for the word <hi>kaly&#257;n</hi> or welfare.<note id="n29.4" n="4">Mr. Girijashankar Karunashankar, Schoolmaster, Songadh.</note>
</p><p>Though the Swastika is widely regarded as the symbol of the sun, some people ascribe the figure to different deities, <hi>viz.</hi>, to Agni,<note id="n29.5" n="5">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Schoolmaster, Dhhank.</note> to Ganpati,<note id="n29.6" n="6">Mr. H. R. Pandya, Khirasar&#257;.</note> to Laxmi,<note id="n29.7" n="7">Mr. D. K. Shah, Charadwa.</note> to Shiva,<note id="n29.8" n="8">The Schoolmaster, Chank, Kolaba.</note> besides the sun. It is also said to represent Swasti, the daughter of Brahma, who received the boon from her father of being worshipped on all auspicious occasions.<note id="n29.9" n="9">Mr. D. K. Shah, Charadwa.</note> Most persons, however, regard the Swastika as the symbol of the sun. It is said that particular figures are prescribed as suitable for the installation of particular deities: a triangle for one, a square for another, a pentagon for a third, and the Swastika for the sun.<note id="n29.10" n="10">Mr. N. M. Dave, S&#257;nk&#257;.</note> The Swastika is worshipped in the Ratnagiri district, and regarded as the symbol as well as the seat of the Sun-god.<note id="n29.11" n="11">The Schoolmaster, Pendhur, Ratnagiri.</note> The people of the Thana district believe the Swastika to be the central point of the helmet of the sun; and a vow, called the <hi>Swastika-vrat</hi>, is observed by women in its honour. The woman draws a figure of the Swastika and worships it daily during the <corr sic="Chaturm&#257;s">Ch&#257;turm&#257;s</corr> (the four months of the rainy season), at the expiration of which she presents a Brahman with a golden or silver plate with the Swastika drawn upon it.<note id="n29.12" n="12">The Schoolmaster, Anj&#257;r.</note>
</p><p>A number of other ideas are prevalent about the significance of the Swastika. Some persons believe that it indicates the four directions;<note id="n29.13" n="13">Mr. Jethabhai Mangaldas, Schoolmaster, Gondal.</note> some think that it represents the four <hi>m&#257;rgas</hi>&#8212;courses or objects of human desires&#8212;<hi>viz.</hi>, (1) Dharma, religion; (2) Artha, wealth; (3) K&#257;m, love; (4) Moksha, salvation.<note id="n29.14" n="14">Mr. Girijashankar Karunashankar, Schoolmaster, Songadh.</note> Some again take it to be an image of the ladder <pb n="30"/>leading to the heavens.<note id="n30.1" n="1">Mr. L. D. Mehta, Mot&#257; Dev&#257;li&#257;.</note> Others suppose it to be a representation of the terrestrial globe, and the four piles of corn placed in the figure, as shown below (p. 16) represent the four mountains, Uday&#257;chala, Ast&#257;chal, Meru and Mand&#257;r&#257;chala.<note id="n30.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster, Ganod.</note> The Swastika is also believed to be the foundation-stone of the universe.<note id="n30.3" n="3">The Schoolmaster, Agashi and Arn&#257;l&#257;<corr sic=",">.</corr></note>
</p><p>The Swastika is much in favour with the gods as a seat or couch, and as soon as it is drawn it is immediately occupied by some deity.<note id="n30.4" n="4">Mr. T. D. Kh&#257;ndh&#257;r, Schoolmaster, Sayala.</note> It is customary therefore to draw the Swastika on most auspicious and festive occasions, such as marriage and thread ceremonies, the first pregnancy ceremonies and the Divali holidays.<note id="n30.5" n="5">Mr. Girijashankar Karunashankar, Songadh.</note> In the Konkan the Swastika is always drawn on the <hi>Antarp&#257;t</hi>, or the piece of cloth which is held between the bride and the bridegroom at the time of a Hindu wedding.<note id="n30.6" n="6">The Schoolmaster, Mith-b&#257;o, Ratnagiri.</note> And at the time of the Puny&#257;ha-w&#257;chan, a ceremony which precedes a Hindu wedding, the figure is drawn in rice and is worshipped.<ref type="noteref" target="n30.6">[#6]</ref> Throughout the Ch&#257;turm&#257;s some persons paint the auspicious Swastikas, either on their thresholds or at their doors, every morning.<note id="n30.7" n="7">Mr. D.

</p><p>On the sixth day from the date of a child&#8217;s birth, a piece of cloth is marked with a Swastika in red lac, the cloth is stretched on a bedstead and the child is placed upon it.<note id="n30.8" n="8">Mr. Jethalal Anupram, Schoolmaster, Aman.</note> An account of this ceremony is to be found in the treatises Jayantishastra, J&#257;takarma, and Janak&#257;laya.<ref type="noteref" target="n30.8">[#8]</ref>
</p><p>Before joining the village-school, little boys are made to worship Saraswati, the goddess of learning, after having installed her on a Swastika, in order that the acquisition of learning may be facilitated.<note id="n30.9" n="9">Mr. M. H. Raval, Vanod.</note>
</p><p>A Brahman host, inviting a party of brother-Brahmans to dinner, marks the figure one (&#2791;) against the names of those who are eligible for dakshin&#257;, and a Swastika against the names of those who are not eligible. These latter are the <hi>yajam&#257;ns</hi> or patrons of the inviting Brahman, who is himself their <hi>p&#363;jya</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, deserving to be worshipped by them. A <hi>bindu</hi> or dot, in place of the Swastika, is considered inauspicious.<note id="n30.10" n="10">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>The Swastika is used in calculating the number of days taken in pilgrimage by one&#8217;s relations, one figure being painted on the wall each day from the date of separation.<ref type="noteref" target="n30.10">[#10]</ref>
</p><p>It is said that the Swastika when drawn on a wall is the representation of Jogm&#257;ya. Jogm&#257;ya is a Natural Power, bringing about the union of two separated beings.<note id="n30.11" n="11">Mr. Girijashankar Karunashankar, Songadh.</note>
</p><p>The Jains paint the Swastika in the way noted below and explain the figure in the following manner:&#8212;The four projectors indicate four kinds of souls: <hi>viz.</hi>, (1) Manushya or human, (2) Tiryach or of lower animals, (3) Deva or divine, (4) Naraki or hellish. The three circular marks denote the three Ratnas or jewels, <hi>viz.</hi>, (1) Jn&#257;n or knowledge, (2) Darshana or faith, (3) Charita or good conduct; and the semi-circular curve, at the top of the three circles, indicates salvation.<note id="n30.12" n="12">Mr. K.

It is also found on Persian and Assyrian coins and in the Catacombs at Rome.

</p><p>&#8216;I am the very light of the sun and the moon,&#8217; observes Lord Krishna in his dialogue with Arjuna,<note id="n31.2" n="2">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Schoolmaster, Dhhank.

Moon-worship secures wealth, augments progeny, and betters the condition of milch-cattle.<note id="n31.3" n="3">Mr. J. A. Jani, Schoolmaster, Aman.</note> The suitable days for such worship are the second and the fourth days of the bright half of every month (Dwit&#299;ya or B&#299;j and Chaturthi or Choth, respectively) and every full-moon day (Purnima or Punema). On either of these days the devotees of Chandra (the moon) fast for the whole of the day and take their food only after the moon has risen and after they have seen and worshipped her.<note id="n31.4" n="4">Mr. N.

</p><p>The fourth day of the dark half of every month is the day for the observance of the <hi>chaturthi-vrat</hi> (or <hi>choth-vrat</hi>). This vrat is observed in honour of the god Ganpati and by men only. The devotees fast on this day, bathe at night after seeing the moon, light a ghi lamp, and offer prayers to the moon. They also recite a <hi>p&#257;th</hi> containing verses in honour of Ganpati, and, after worshipping that god, take their food consisting of some specially prepared dish. This <hi>vrat</hi> is said to fulfil the dreams of the devotees.<note id="n31.10" n="10">Mr. G. K. Bhatt, Songadh.</note>
</p><p>The day for the <hi>chaturthi-vrat</hi> in the month of Bh&#257;drapad (the 11th month of the Gujarati Hindus) is the fourth day of the bright half instead of the fourth day of the dark half,<note id="n31.11" n="11">Mr. K.

It so happened that the god Ganpati fell off his usual charger, the rat, and this awkward mishap drew a smile from Chandra (the moon). Ganpati, not relishing the joke, became angry and cursed Chandra saying that no mortal would care to see his face on that day (which happened to be the fourth day of the bright half of Bh&#257;drapad). If any one happens to see the moon even unwittingly on this day, he may expect trouble very soon.<note id="n32.2" n="2">The Deputy Educational Inspector, Gohelwad.</note> There is one way, however, out of the difficulty, and that is to throw stones on the houses of neighbours. When the neighbours utter abuse in return, the abuse atones for the sin of having looked at the moon on the forbidden night. The day is therefore called (in Gujarat) <hi>Dagad-choth</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the Choth of stones.<note id="n32.3" n="3">Mr. K. D. Desai.</note>
</p><p>On the fourth day of the dark half of Ph&#257;lgun (the 5th month of Gujarati Hindus) some villagers fast for the whole of the day and remain standing from sunset till the moon rises.

</p><p>Virgins sometimes observe a vow on Poshi-Punema or the full-moon day of Pausha (the 3rd month of the Gujarati Hindus). On this day a virgin prepares her evening meal with her own hands on the upper terrace of her house.

<pb n="33"/></p><p>The appearance of the moon and the position of the horns of her crescent at particular times are carefully watched as omens of future events. Cultivators believe that if the moon is visible on the second day of the bright half of &#256;sh&#257;dh (the 9th month of Gujarati Hindus), the sesamum crops of that season will be abundant; but if the moon be hidden from sight on that day, the weather will be cloudy during the whole of &#256;sh&#257;dh, and will prove unfavourable to vegetable growth.<note id="n33.1" n="1">Mr. N.

If the two horns are on a level, current prices will continue.<ref type="noteref" target="n33.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>Similarly, the northern horn of the crescent, if it is high up on the B&#299;j day of &#256;sh&#257;dh, augurs abundant rainfall; if it is low, it foreshadows a season of drought.<note id="n33.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster, Kh&#257;ndh&#257;r.</note>
</p><p>If the moon presents a greenish aspect on the full-moon day of &#256;sh&#257;dh, excessive rains may be expected in a few days; if on that day she rises quite clear and reddish, there is very little hope of good rains; if she is partly covered by clouds when she rises and then gets clear of the clouds, and then again disappears in the clouds in three <hi>ghadis</hi>,<note id="n33.a" n="A">One <hi>ghadi</hi> is equal to 24 minutes and one <hi>pohor</hi> (prahara) lasts for three hours.</note> three <hi>pohors</hi>,<ref type="noteref" target="n33.a">[#A]</ref> or three days, rain is sure to fall.<note id="n33.3" n="3">Mr. M.

</p><p>The B&#299;j (2nd day) and the ninth day of &#256;sh&#257;dh (the 9th month of the Gujaratis and the 4th month of the Hindus of the Deccan) falling on a Sunday is a combination that foretells excessive heat.

</p><p>The spots on the moon have given rise to numerous beliefs, mythological as well as fanciful. One of them is that they are the result of a curse, pronounced by the sage Gautama on Chandra. Indra, the god of rain, was infatuated with the charms of Ahaly&#257;, the wife of Gautama, and with the help of Chandra laid a cunning plot to gain his ignoble object. Accordingly, one night, Chandra set earlier than usual, when Indra assumed the form of a cock and crowed at midnight in order to deceive Gautama into the belief that it was dawn, and therefore his time for going to the Ganges to perform his religious services. The trick was successful, and the holy sage being thus got rid of, Indra assumed the form of Gautama himself and approached Ahaly&#257;, who was surprised to see her husband (as she thought) so quickly returned. The wily god allayed her suspicions by explaining that it was not yet time for the morning ceremonies, and thus enjoyed the favours due to her husband. Gautama, in the meanwhile, finding the water of the Ganges cool and placid, and discovering that it was not yet dawn, returned to his hermitage. On reaching home he detected the treachery of Indra, who tried to escape in the disguise of a tom-cat. The exasperated sage then cursed Indra, Chandra and his wife: Indra to have a thousand sores on his person, Ahaly&#257; to turn into a stone, and Chandra to have a stain on his fair face.<note id="n33.7" n="7">The Schoolmasters of Dhhank, Rajpara and Limbdi<corr>.</corr></note>
</p><p>Another mythological story is that Daksha Praj&#257;pati, the son of Brahm&#257;, gave all his <pb n="34"/>twenty-seven daughters in marriage to Chandra, who was inspired with love for one of them only, named Rohini, the most beautiful of them all. The slighted twenty-six sisters complained to their father, Daksha, of Chandra&#8217;s preference for Rohini. Daksha in anger cursed Chandra to be attacked by consumption (which is supposed to be the reason of the waning of the moon) and his face to be marred by a stain.<note id="n34.1" n="1">The Schoolmaster, Rajpara.</note>
</p><p>The curse of Gautama and the curse of Daksha are also supposed to be reasons of the waxing and the waning of the moon.
</p><p>Another belief regarding the moon-spots is that when the head of Ganpati was severed by Shiva&#8217;s trident, it flew off and fell into the chariot of the moon. The spots are either the head itself<note id="n34.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster, Dadvi.</note> or are due to drops of blood fallen from the flying severed head.<note id="n34.3" n="3">The Schoolmaster, Lilapur.</note>
</p><p>The spots are also said to be explained by the fact of the image of god Krishna or Vishnu<note id="n34.a" n="A">Throughout the Hindu Scriptures, Vishnu and his incarnations are described as being of <hi>Shyama-varna</hi> or dark complexion.&#8212;Mr. K. D. Desai.</note> residing in the heart of the moon who, as a devotee of Vishnu, holds his image dear to his heart.<note id="n34.4" n="4">The Schoolmaster, Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>The moon is often called <hi>mrig&#257;nka</hi> (lit. deer-marked) and <hi><corr sic="mriga&#8212;l&#257;nchhana">mriga-l&#257;nchhana</corr></hi> (lit<corr>.</corr> deer-stained); and a further explanation of the spots in this connection is that the moon-god took into his lap a strayed deer, out of compassion, and thus his lap became stained.<note id="n34.5" n="5">The Deputy Educational Inspector, Halar.</note> Jains believe that in the nether parts of the moon&#8217;s <hi>vim&#257;n</hi> or vehicle, there is an image of a deer whose shadow is seen in the spots.<note id="n34.6" n="6">Mr. K.

</p><p>Sweetened milk or water is exposed to moonlight during the whole of the night of <pb n="35"/>Sharad-punema (the full-moon day of Ashvin) in order to absorb the nectarine rays of the moon, and is drunk next morning.

</p><p rend="align(right)">Rao Saheb P. B. Joshi.</p></note> These were distributed among them. Lakshmi, the <hi>kaustubha</hi> jewel, the Sh&#257;rnga bow and the conch-shell fell to the share of Vishnu, and the poison, <hi>Hal&#257;hal visha</hi>, was disposed of to Shiva. Only two things remained, <hi>sudh&#257;</hi>, or nectar, and <hi>sur&#257;</hi> or liquor. To both gods and demons the nectar was the most important of all the prizes. A hard contest ensuing between them for the possession of it, the demons, by force, snatched the bowl of nectar from the gods. In this disaster to the gods, Vishnu came to their help in the form of Mohini&#8212;a most fascinating woman&#8212;and proposed to the demons that the distribution of the immortalising fluid should be entrusted to her. On their consent, Vishnu or Mohini, made the gods and the demons sit in opposite rows and began first to serve the nectar to the gods. The demon R&#257;hu, the son of Sinhik&#257;, fearing lest the whole of the nectar might be exhausted before the turn of the demons came, took the shape of a god and placed himself amongst them between Chandra (the moon) and S&#363;rya (the sun). The nectar was served to him in turn, but on Chandra and S&#363;rya detecting the trick, the demon&#8217;s head was cut off by Vishnu&#8217;s discus, the <hi>sudarshana-chakra</hi>. R&#257;hu however did not die: for he had tasted the nectar, which had reached his throat. The head and trunk lived and became immortal, the former being named R&#257;hu, and the latter Ketu. Both swore revenge on Chandra and S&#363;rya. At times, therefore, they pounce upon Chandra and S&#363;rya with the intention of devouring them. In the fight that ensues, Chandra and S&#363;rya are successful only after a long contest, with the assistance of the gods, and by the merit of the prayers that men offer.<note id="n35.4" n="4">The Schoolmasters of Jodia, Dhhank, Songadh, Rajpara, and Limbdi.</note>
</p><p>The reason of the eclipse is either that Chandra and S&#363;rya bleed in the fight with R&#257;hu and their forms get blackened<note id="n35.5" n="5">The Schoolmaster of Khir&#257;sara.</note>; or that the demon R&#257;hu comes between the two luminaries and this earth, and thus causes an eclipse<note id="n35.6" n="6">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Dhhank.</note>; or because R&#257;hu obstructs the sun and the moon in their daily course, and this intervention causes an eclipse<note id="n35.7" n="7">Mr. Laxmichand Hemji, Vas&#257;wad.</note>; or because R&#257;hu swallows the sun and the moon, but his throat being open, they escape, their short disappearance causing an eclipse.<note id="n35.8" n="8">Mr. G. K. Bhatt, Songadh.</note>
</p><p>Besides the mythological story, there is a belief in Gujarat that a <hi>bhangi</hi> (scavenger or sweeper), creditor of the sun and the moon, goes to recover his debts due from them, and that his shadow falling against either of them causes an eclipse.<note id="n35.9" n="9">Mr. K. P. Joshi<corr>,</corr> Limbdi.</note>
<pb n="36"/></p><p>A third explanation of the eclipse is that the sun and the moon revolve round the Meru mountain, and the shadow of the mountain falling upon either of them causes an eclipse.<note id="n36.1" n="1">Mr. K. P. Joshi, Limbdi.</note>
</p><p>It is believed amongst Hindus that eclipses occur when too much sin accumulates in this world.<note id="n36.2" n="2">Mr K. D. Desai.</note> Most Hindus regard an eclipse as ominous, and consider the eclipse period to be unholy and inauspicious. The contact of the demon R&#257;hu with the rays of the sun and the moon pollutes everything on earth. Great precautions therefore become necessary to avoid pollution.<note id="n36.3" n="3">Mr. Laxmichand Hemji, Vas&#257;wad.</note> A period of three <hi>pohors</hi><note id="n36.a" n="A">A <hi>pohor</hi> or <hi>prahar</hi> is equal to three hours.</note> (<hi>prahars</hi>) in the case of the moon, and of four in the case of the sun, before the actual commencement of an eclipse, is known as <hi>vedha</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the time when the luminaries are already under the influence of the demon. During this period and during the time of an eclipse people observe a strict fast. Anyone taking food within the prohibited period is considered <hi>sutaki</hi> or ceremonially impure, as if a death had happened in his family.<note id="n36.4" n="4">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Dhhank.</note> An exception is, however, made in the case of children, pregnant women and suckling mothers who cannot bear the privation of a strict fast. From the beginning of an eclipse to its end, everything in the house is believed to be polluted, if touched.<ref type="noteref" target="n36.4">[#4]</ref>
</p><p>As the sun and the moon are believed to be in trouble during an eclipse, people offer prayers to God from the beginning of the <hi>vedha</hi> for their release. It is the custom to visit some holy place on an eclipse-day, to take a bath there, and to read holy passages from the Sh&#257;stras. Some people, especially Brahmans, sit devoutly on river-banks and offer prayers to the sun.<ref type="noteref" target="n36.4">[#4]</ref> Much secret as well as open charity is given at the time of an eclipse. But the receivers of charity during the actual period of an eclipse are the lowest classes only, such as <hi>bhangis</hi>, <hi>mah&#257;rs</hi> and <hi>m&#257;ngs</hi>. When an eclipse is at its full, these people go about the streets giving vent to such cries as <hi lang="gu-latn" xml:lang="gu-latn">&#257;p&#243; d&#257;n chhut&#233; ch&#257;nd</hi> (give alms for the relief of the moon!).<note id="n36.5" n="5">Mr. Khan Bahadur Fazlullah.</note>
</p><p>Among the gifts such people receive are cotton clothes, cash, grain such as sesamum seeds, <hi>udad</hi>, pulses, and salt.<note id="n36.6" n="6">The Schoolmasters of Jodia and Songadh.</note> The gift of a pair of shoes is much recommended.<note id="n36.7" n="7">Mr. K. D. Desai.</note> Sometimes a figure of the eclipsed sun or moon is drawn in <hi>juari</hi> seeds and given away to a <hi>bhangi</hi>.<note id="n36.8" n="8">Mr. N. D. Vora, Rajpara.</note>
</p><p>Although the period of an eclipse is considered inauspicious, it is valued by those who profess the black art. All <hi>mantras</hi>, incantations, and <hi>prayogas</hi>, applications or experiments, which ordinarily require a long time to take effect, produce the wished for result without delay if performed during the process of an eclipse.<note id="n36.9" n="9">Mr. G. K<corr>.</corr> Bhatt, Songadh.</note>
</p><p>If a man&#8217;s wife is pregnant, he may not smoke during the period of an eclipse lest his child become deformed.<note id="n36.10" n="10">Mr. K. D<corr>.</corr> Desai.</note> Ploughing a farm on a lunar-eclipse day is supposed to cause the birth of Ch&#257;ndr&#257;-children, <hi>i.e.</hi>, children afflicted by the moon.<ref type="noteref" target="n36.10">[#10]</ref>
</p><p>After an eclipse Hindus bathe, perform ablution ceremonies, and dress themselves in clean garments. The houses are cleansed by cowdunging the floors, vessels are rubbed and cleansed, and clothes are washed, in order to get rid of the pollution caused by the eclipse.<note id="n36.11" n="11">The Schoolmaster of Jodia.</note> Unwashed clothes of cotton, wool, silk or hemp, according to popular belief, do not become polluted.<ref type="noteref" target="n36.11">[#11]</ref> The placing of <hi>darbha</hi> grass on things which are otherwise liable to pollution is also sufficient to keep them unpolluted.<note id="n36.12" n="12">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>Brahmans cannot accept anything during the impious time of an eclipse, but after it <pb n="37"/>is over, alms are freely given to them in the shape of such costly articles as fine clothes, gold, cattle and the like.<note id="n37.1" n="1">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>After an eclipse Hindus may not break their fast till they have again seen the full disc of the released sun or the moon. It sometimes happens that the sun or the moon sets <hi>gher&#257;yal&#257;</hi> (while still eclipsed), and people have then to fast for the whole of the night or the day after, until the sun or the moon is again fully visible.<note id="n37.2" n="2">Mr. K. D. Desai.</note>
</p><p>There is a <hi>shloka</hi> in the <hi>Jyotish-Sh&#257;stra</hi> to the effect that R&#257;hu would surely devour Chandra if the <hi>nakshatra</hi>, or constellation of the second day of the dark half of a preceding month, were to recur on the Purnima (full-moon day) of the succeeding month. Similarly, in solar eclipses, a similar catastrophe would occur if the constellation of the second day of the bright half of a month were to recur on the Am&#257;v&#257;sya (the last day) of that month.<note id="n37.3" n="3">Mr. D. K. Shah, Charadwah.</note> The year in which many eclipses occur is believed to prove a bad year for epidemic diseases.<note id="n37.4" n="4">Mr. T. D. Khandhar, Sayala.</note>
</p><p>The Jains do not believe in the Hindu theory of <hi>grahana</hi> (or the eclipse).<note id="n37.5" n="5">The Schoolmaster, Jodia.</note> Musalmans do not perform the special ceremonies beyond the recital of special prayers; and even these are held to be supererogatory.<note id="n37.6" n="6">Khan Bahadur Fazlullah.</note>
</p><p>With the exception that some people believe that the stars are the abodes of the gods,<note id="n37.7" n="7">Mr. M. M. Rana, Barton Female Training College, Rajkot.</note> the popular belief about the heavenly bodies seems to be that they are the souls of virtuous and saintly persons, translated to the heavens for their good deeds and endowed with a lustre proportionate to their merits.<note id="n37.8" n="8">Mr. Nandlal Kalidas, Chhatrasa, and Mr. M. M. Rana, Barton Female Training College, Rajkot.</note> And this idea is illustrated in the traditions that are current about some of the stars. The seven bright stars of the constellation <hi>Saptarshi</hi> (or the Great Bear) are said to be the seven sages, Kashyapa, Atri, Bh&#257;radw&#257;j, Vishw&#257;mitra, Gautama, J&#257;madagni and Vasishtha, who had mastered several parts of the <hi>Vedas</hi>, and were considered specialists in the branches studied by each, and were invested with divine honours in reward for their proficiency.<note id="n37.9" n="9">Mr. Motichand Vasanji Doshi, K&#257;luwad.</note> Another story relates how a certain hunter and his family, who had unconsciously achieved great religious merit, were installed as the constellation <hi>Saptarshi</hi><note id="n37.a" n="A"><p>I believe the name of the constellation is wrongly given: it ought to be Mriga. One of the stars in this group, known as &#8216;Sirius&#8217;, in Western astronomy, is often called Vy&#257;dha (<hi>i.e.</hi>, the hunter).&#8212;Mr. K. T. Gupte.
</p><p>The Mrig constellation is also said to represent the goddess Saraswati, who had assumed the form of a gazelle in order to escape the amorous grasp of Brahm&#257;, her father. While the deer in the Mrig constellation is Saraswati, the Ardra constellation is Mah&#257;dev who had followed to chastise Brahma, who also is seen as the Brahma constellation.&#8212;Mr. N. M. Dave, S&#257;nk&#257;.</p></note> (or the Great Bear). A hunter, it is narrated in the <hi>Shivar&#257;tri-m&#257;h&#257;tmya</hi>, was arrested for debt on a <hi>Shivr&#257;tri</hi><note id="n37.b" n="B">The thirteenth day of both the bright and dark halves of a month, sacred to the worship of god Shiva.</note> day, and while in jail heard by chance the words &#8216;Shiva, Shiva&#8217; repeated by some devotees. Without understanding their meaning, he also began to repeat the same words, even after he was released in the evening. He had received no food during the day, and had thus observed a compulsory fast. In order to obtain food for himself and his family, he stationed himself behind a <hi>Bel</hi><note id="n37.c" n="C">The three-leaf-clusters of this tree are loved by the god Shiva if put upon his image.&#8212;Mr. K. D. Desai.</note> tree, hoping to shoot a deer or some other animal that might come to quench its thirst at a neighbouring tank. While adjusting an arrow to his bowstring, <pb n="38"/>he plucked some leaves out of the thick foliage of the tree and threw them down. The leaves, however, chanced to fall on a <hi>Shiva-linga</hi> which happened to stand below, and secured for him the merit of having worshipped god Shiva with Bel-leaves on a <hi>Shivr&#257;tri</hi> day. He was also all the while repeating the god&#8217;s name and had undergone a fast. The result was that not only were his past sins forgiven, but he was placed with his family in heaven.<note id="n38.1" n="1">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>Similarly, Dhruva, the son of king Utt&#257;nap&#257;d, attained divine favour by unflagging devotion, and was given a constant place in the heavens as the immovable pole-star.<note id="n38.2" n="2">Mr. N. M. Dave, S&#257;nk&#257;.</note>
</p><p>According to Hindu astrology, there are nine <hi>grahas</hi><note id="n38.a" n="A">The nine <hi>grahas</hi> are, Ravi (the Sun), Chandra (the Moon), Mangal (Mars), Budha (Mercury), Guru (Jupiter), Shukra (Venus), Shani (Saturn), and R&#257;hu and Ketu.</note> or planets, twelve <hi>r&#257;shis</hi><note id="n38.b" n="B">The names of the twelve <hi>r&#257;shis</hi> are:&#8212;1 Mesha (Aries), 2 Vrishabha (Taurus), 3 Mithun (Gemini), 4 Karka (Cancer), 5 Sinha (Leo), 6 Kany&#257; (Virgo), 7 Tul&#257; (Libra), 3 Vrishchika (Scorpio), 9 Dhanu (Sagittarius), 10 Makara (Capricornus)<corr>,</corr> 11 Kumbha (Aquarius), 12 Mina (Pisces).</note> or signs of the zodiac, and twenty-seven <hi>nakshatras</hi><note id="n38.c" n="C">The following are the twenty-seven <hi>nakshatras</hi>:&#8212;1 Ashvini, 2 Bharani, 3 Kritik&#257;<corr>,</corr> 4 Rohin&#299;, 5 Mrig, 6 Ardra, 7 Punarvasu, 8 Pushya, 9 &#256;shlesha, 10 Magha, 11 P&#363;rv&#257;-ph&#257;lguni, 12 Uttara-ph&#257;lguni, 13 Hasta, 14 Chitr&#257;, 15 Sw&#257;ti, 16 Vish&#257;kha, 17 Anur&#257;dha, 18 Jyeshth&#257;, 19 M&#363;l, 20 P&#363;rv&#257;sh&#257;dha, 21 Uttar&#257;sh&#257;dha, 22 Shravana, 23 Dhanishtha, 24 Shatat&#257;rak&#257;, 25 P&#363;rv&#257;bh&#257;drapada, 26 Uttar&#257;bhadrapada, and 27 Revat&#299;.</note> or constellations. Books on astrology explain the distinct forms of the <hi>nakshatras</hi>. For instance, the Ashvini constellation consists of two stars and presents the appearance of a horse. It ascends the zenith at midnight on the <hi>purnima</hi> (the 15th day of the bright half) of Ashvin (the first month of the Gujarati Hindus). The constellation of Mrig consists of seven stars, four like the legs of a sofa and three others under them in a line. All these twenty-seven groups of stars reach the zenith at midnight on particular days in particular months; and the months of the Hindu calendar are named after them.<note id="n38.3" n="3">Mr. D. K. Pandya, Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>All planets influence the life of a person, one way or the other, according to their position in the heavens at the time of his birth. A <hi>kundali</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, a figure like the one shown here, is drawn by astrologers to illustrate the respective positions of the planets. The twelve squares of the diagram represent the twelve signs of the zodiac, and the positions of the planets in different squares influence persons in different ways. Ravi (the Sun), Budha (Mercury) and Shukra (Venus) occupy one <hi>r&#257;shi</hi> for one month; Chandra (the Moon) occupies a <hi>r&#257;shi</hi> for 135 <hi>ghadis</hi>,<note id="n38.d" n="D">One <hi>ghadi</hi> = 24 minutes.</note> <hi>i.e.</hi>, two days and a quarter; Mangal (Mars) for one month and a half; Guru (Jupiter) for thirteen months; Shani (Saturn) for two years and a half, and R&#257;hu for a year and a half. This is their normal and ordinary motion. But if they take an abnormal course and move either too fast or too slow, they finish their revolution through a <hi>r&#257;shi</hi> within a shorter or a longer period.<note id="n38.4" n="4">Mr. Motechand Vasanji Doshi, K&#257;l&#257;wad.</note>

</p><p>If the planet Guru (Jupiter) occupies either the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, or 12th, square of a <hi>kundali</hi>, it is said to bring about a rupture with friends, pecuniary wants, and an increase in the number of enemies.<note id="n38.5" n="5">The Schoolmaster, Dadvi.</note>
<pb n="39"/></p><p>If Shani (Saturn) occupies the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, or the 12th square in a man&#8217;s <hi>kundali</hi>, it causes despondency of mind, family quarrels, imminent injuries from foes, and pecuniary wants.<note id="n39.1" n="1">The Schoolmaster or Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>The presence of Mangal (Mars) in the 3rd, the 6th, or the 11th square is auspicious.<ref type="noteref" target="n39.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>Of the nine planets, Budha, Guru, and Chandra are benevolent, Mangal and Ravi are neither benevolent nor baneful; and Shani, R&#257;hu, and Ketu are downright malevolent.<note id="n39.2" n="2">N. M. Dave, S&#257;nk&#257;.</note> Each planet has a story connected with it concerning its benevolence or malevolence, and showing also the way to secure its propitiation. For instance, the malevolence of Shani drove King Vikrama to unknown countries, and subjected him to grave calamities. On the advice of a wise man, however, he observed the Saturday-vows and thus overcame his difficulties.<note id="n39.3" n="3">M. H. Raval, Vanod.</note>
</p><p>When a planet is unfavourable to a person, it has to be propitiated by vows, and the person who is under its evil influence often lays upon himself the obligation of abstaining from particular articles of food or from wearing certain articles of clothing for a certain number of days.<note id="n39.4" n="4">Hirji Monji, Ganod.</note> Particular days of the week are set apart as appropriate for the worship of particular planets, and, on such days, the person keeping the vow observes a fast and worships the planet through the medium of a Br&#257;hman.<note id="n39.5" n="5">N. D. Vora, Rajpara.</note> For instance, <hi>vrats</hi> or vows are observed on Tuesdays in honour of Mangal (Mars), when an image of the planet, engraved on a golden dish, is worshipped, and the person observing the vow takes food consisting of wheat only, and that too, only once during the day. This mode of fasting is followed for a number of consecutive Tuesdays prescribed by an astrologer; and on the last Tuesday, when <hi>p&#363;rn&#257;huti</hi><note id="n39.a" n="A"><hi>I.e.</hi>, a handful of rice, ghi, cocoanuts, and some other objects are cast into the fire as an offering.</note> is offered, Br&#257;hmans are feasted and <hi>dakshina</hi> is given to them. A piece of red cloth and some corn are used in the installation of the planet; these and the golden engraving are carried away by the priest.<ref type="noteref" target="n39.3">[#3]</ref>
</p><p>Similarly, in propitiating R&#257;hu and Ketu the same ceremonies are gone through: only, instead of wheat, <hi>mug</hi> (<corr sic="Phasoleus">Phaseolus</corr> mungo) is eaten by the devotee. In the same way Shani (Saturn) is said to favour the diet of <hi>ad&#257;d</hi> (or lentils): Guru (Jupiter) inclines to <hi>chana</hi> (or gram), while Shukra (Venus) favours <hi>chol&#257;</hi> (dolichos sinensis).<ref type="noteref" target="n39.3">[#3]</ref>
</p><p>Certain forms or figures, called <hi>mandals</hi>, are favoured by particular <hi>grah&#257;s</hi>, and are drawn in their honour in worshipping them. Different things, too, are given in charity in honour of different planets.<note id="n39.6" n="6">Gangaram Tribhowandas, Lilapur.</note>
</p><p>All the nine <hi>grahas</hi> and the twenty-seven nakshatras are worshipped on the occasion of the <hi>Griha-Shanti</hi> ceremony, which is performed before occupying a newly erected building.<ref type="noteref" target="n39.2">[#2]</ref>
</p><p>It is considered inauspicious to hold a marriage ceremony while Shukra (Venus) is invisible. In such a case, however, the ceremony may be performed after setting up and worshipping a small golden image of the planet.
</p><p>Of the stars, the constellation of <hi>saptarshi</hi> is perhaps the one most often worshipped. Its worship forms a part of the ceremonies performed on the occasion of investing boys with the sacred thread<note id="n39.7" n="7">D. K. Pandya, Dhh&#257;nk.</note> and also of the ceremonies of marriage. The worship of the <hi>saptarshi</hi> on marriage occasions is believed to be an attestation of the marriage, and to secure the benign care of the <hi>saptarshi</hi> for the couple. The form of worship is sometimes as follows: a red and white piece of <pb n="40"/>cloth is stretched on the ground, bearing an image of the <hi>saptarshi</hi> over it; wheat and rice are scattered over the cloth, a ghi-lamp is lighted, and red lac and flowers are offered to the image.<note id="n40.1" n="1">K. P. Joshi, Limbdi.</note> Another form of worship is to mark seven red-lac-dots on a <hi>p&#257;tla</hi> or a wooden stool, and to place seven pice and seven betel-nuts thereon. After worshipping the seven pice, the bridal pair are made to take four turns round the stool, touching the stool with their great toes at every turn. A proverb runs to the effect that, whatever may happen to the couple, still the seven pice of <hi>satpati</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi>, the ceremony described) are secure.<note id="n40.2" n="2">R. B. Pandya, Jetpur Sanskrit Pathash&#257;l&#257;.</note> A third process is to form seven small piles of <hi>kamod</hi>,<note id="n40.a" n="A">A superior kind of rice.</note> on each of which, successively, the bride places her right foot while the bridegroom removes each pile one by one.<note id="n40.3" n="3">The Schoolmaster of Khirasar&#257;.</note>

Indra, jealous of the growing power of Sagar, stole the horse and concealed it in the hermitage of Kapila, when the sage was deeply absorbed in religious meditation. The sixty thousand sons of Sagar followed it to this asylum, where they taunted and insulted the sage, believing him to be the thief. Kapila, who was ignorant of the theft, opened his long-closed eyes in anger, emitting sparks of flame from them, and destroyed the sons of Sagar together with the whole of their army. Bhag&#299;rath, the grandson of Sagar, propitiated the sage, and on his advice practised religious austerities in honour of Shiva for the purpose of bringing down the River Ganga from heaven. Through the kindness of God Shiva, Bhag&#299;rath was at last successful in bringing the celestial river down to this world; and with the water of the river he revived the sons of Sagar.

</p><p>The prevalent belief about lightning seems to be that it is the girl whom Kansa tried to dash against a stone, but who escaped and went up to the sky. Kansa, the tyrant king of Mathura, was informed by a heavenly voice, by way of prophecy, that a son would be born to his sister who would cause his destruction. Kansa thereupon confined his sister Devaki and her husband Vasudeva in prison, loaded them with fetters, and kept the strictest watch over them. He took from Devaki, and slew, every child of hers as soon as it was born. In this way he disposed of her first six children. On the seventh occasion, however, on which Devaki gave birth to a son named Krishna, a girl was born at the same hour to Nanda in Mathura; and Vasudeva secretly interchanged the two children in spite of the vigilance of Kansa. When Kansa knew of his sister having been delivered, he seized the infant girl and tried to dash her against a stone. The little one immediately flew away to the skies, where she still dwells in the form of <hi>Vijli</hi> or lightning.<note id="n47.3" n="3">The Schoolmasters of Dhhank, Sanka, Limbdi, and Sultanpur.</note>

</p><p>The most popular of the holy rivers are the Ganges, the Jumna (or Jamuna), the Narbad&#257;, the Saraswati (near Sidhpur), the K&#257;veri, the God&#257;vari, the Gandaki, the Sarayu, the D&#257;modari, the Sindhu (or Indus), the Mah&#257;nad, the Gomati (near Dw&#257;rka), the Brahmaputra, the S&#257;barmati, the Ghels (near Gaddheda), the Tungabhadra, the Suvarnabhadr&#257;, the Bhadrashit&#257;, the Jambuvati, the Phalaku (or Phalgu), the Kaushiki, the T&#257;mraparni, the Sita and the Alakanand&#257;. Any point where three rivers meet is also a sacred place. Most of the holy rivers are the subject of many traditions, and books have been written to celebrate their merits.
</p><p>The Ganges, the Jumna, and the God&#257;vari are said to be the holiest of all rivers.<ref type="noteref" target="n49.9">[#9]</ref> There are a number of beliefs about the origin of the Ganges. One of them is that the Ganges is the stream caused by King Bali washing the feet of V&#257;man (the Dwarf incarnation of Vishnu).<note id="n49.11" n="11">Mr. M. M. Rana<corr>,</corr> Rajkot.</note> Another story relates that the god Brahma was exhausted by overwork at the time of the marriage of Shiva and P&#257;rvati. The gods, therefore, created water from their own lustres, and gave it to Brahma in a gourd, to be used in a similar contingency. When Vishnu in his <hi>V&#257;man avat&#257;r</hi> (or Dwarf incarnation) bestrode the heavens with a single step, Brahma washed his toe in the water from this gourd. A stream was thus created called Swarga-ganga <pb n="50"/>and brought down to the earth by Bhag&#299;rath, the grandson of Sagar. When the Ganges fell from the heavens, it was supported and held fast by God Shiva in his <hi>jat&#257;</hi> or matted hair. It was released by his loosening the hair, and in its course, inundated the sacrificial ground of King Jahnu. The latter, being angry, drank up its waters. On the entreaties of Bhag&#299;rath, he released the stream by tearing off his thigh.<note id="n50.a" n="A">The river is, therefore, regarded as his daughter, and is called Jahnavi.</note> The river then flowed to the spot where the sixty thousand sons of Sagar were burnt to ashes; and it is said by some that one of the sixty thousand was saved at the end of each year up to the year 1955 of the Samvat era (corresponding to <hi rend="sc">A. D.</hi> 1899), by the end of which period all the sixty thousand had attained salvation. From the earth the Ganges went to the nether regions. Thus flowing in the heavens, on the earth and in the P&#257;t&#257;l, the Ganges is called Tripathaga (<hi>i.e.</hi>, flowing in three courses). In its divine form, the Ganges is the wife of Shiva. Owing to the curse of Brahma, she was born in human form in this world and was married to Shantanu, by whom she became the mother of Bhishma, the heroic uncle of the Kauravas and the P&#257;ndavas.<note id="n50.1" n="1">Mr. M. M. Rana, Rajkot.</note>
</p><p>It is customary among Hindu pilgrims, when they visit K&#257;shi (Benares) to take with them copper-vessels filled with <hi>Gang&#257;jal</hi> (water of the Ganges), and to worship the Gang&#257; when they reach their homes after the pilgrimage. A figure is drawn in seven different kinds of corn; the bowl is placed on it; <hi>abil gul&#257;l</hi> (red powder), frankincense, and <hi>naivedya</hi> (an oblation of food) are offered: a ghi lamp is lighted: a Brahman woman is dressed as Uma, the wife of Shiva, and Brahmans are entertained at a feast, <hi>dakshina</hi> being given to them.<note id="n50.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Lilapur.</note>
</p><p>The water of the Ganges, as well as that of the Jumna, is believed to be so pure that it cannot be affected by microbes, even if kept for years in the house. This quality is believed to be a manifestation of its divine nature. It is further called <hi>patit-p&#257;van</hi> (lit. purifier of the fallen), and exculpates the sinful from their sins, either by a single draught or by bathing in it.<note id="n50.3" n="3">Mr. D.

</p><p>Sometimes ghi lamps are placed upon the waters of the Ganges or the Jumna, and vessels of metal, pice, and cocoanuts are cast into the stream.

</p><p>Two kings once agreed that the two children that should first be born to them should marry each other. But it happened that both the kings had daughters. One of them, however, concealed the fact, and gave out that the child born to him was a son. So that when the children attained a <corr sic="marriagable">marriageable</corr> age, they were married to each other according to the agreement.
</p><p>But the wife found out the secret when she went to stay with her supposed husband, and disclosed it to her parents, who invited the counterfeit son-in-law to their house with the object of ascertaining the truth. The alleged son, however, suspected the design and fled, with a mare and a bitch. On arriving near M&#257;n-sarovar, the animals went into the lake in order to refresh themselves, when there was an immediate transformation; and the bitch and the mare came out a horse and a dog.

</p><p>Mountains are held to be sacred in a variety of circumstances; thus, some are valued for possessing medicinal drugs: some are revered as the birthplaces of the gods, or as the residences of saints: some for possessing many <hi>t&#299;rthas</hi> (holy spots): some because they were visited by R&#257;ma or the P&#257;ndavas: some serve as guardians of the four quarters: and some contain the sources of holy rivers.
</p><p>Both the important ranges of the Presidency, the Sahy&#257;dri and the S&#257;tpuda, are subjects of veneration in the popular mind.

</p><p>Han&#363;m&#257;n, the monkey-god, once promised to take the Mountain Govardhan to meet R&#257;ma.

</p><p>It is said that the inhabitants of the districts round Govardhan formerly revered and adored Indra. But Krishna condemned this custom, and introduced the worship of Govardhan. Indra was exasperated at this conduct, and poured tremendous rains on Gokal in order to drown Krishna and his followers. But Krishna held up the Govardhan mountain on his little finger and sheltered all his people under its cover. The mountain was supported in this manner for seven days, by the end of which the rains subsided and Indra confessed himself vanquished.

Owing to the excessive cold, the place is extremely difficult to reach. Pilgrims carry burning hearths with them to protect themselves against cold. Besides, it is necessary to cross the Pathar-nadi (or stony river), of which the water, if touched, turns one into stone.

</p><p>Mount Kail&#257;sa, the abode of Shiva, is supposed to be situated in the northern part of the Him&#257;layas.

</p><p>The changes in the seasons are attributed by some to Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesha (Shiva), the gods of the Hindu Trinity. Brahma sends down the rains and produces corn, grass, etc., Vishnu protects and nourishes the harvests in winter, and Shiva causes the heat of the summer.<note id="n60.6" n="6">The Schoolmaster of Zinzuw&#257;d&#257;.</note> There is also a belief that these three gods go down in turns to the <hi>p&#257;t&#257;l</hi> (nether regions) and stay there for four months. Vishnu descends on the eleventh day of the bright half of &#256;sh&#257;dh, and on that day the rainy season begins. When Vishnu comes up and Shiva takes his place, people experience the cold of winter: but as this god always keeps a <hi>dhuni</hi><note id="n60.c" n="C">Fire used for the purposes of smoking.</note> burning near him, the waters under the surface of the earth, such as those in the wells, remain hot during this period.

</p><p>According to another belief, the sequence of the seasons is controlled by the sun-god.<note id="n60.8" n="8">The Schoolmasters of Dhhank and Gondal Taluka.</note> There are six <hi>ritus</hi> or seasons: and the changes in the <hi>ritus</hi> depend upon the position of the sun in the twelve <hi>r&#257;shis</hi> or signs of the Zodiac.<note id="n60.9" n="9">The Shastri of Jetpur<corr sic=",">.</corr></note> Each <hi>ritu</hi> lasts for a period of two months, during which time the sun travels through two <hi>r&#257;shis</hi>. <hi>Vasant-ritu</hi> is the period which the sun takes to pass through the <hi>Min</hi> (Pisces) and <hi>Mesha</hi> (Aries) <hi>r&#257;shis</hi>. <hi>Grishma-ritu</hi> corresponds to the time during which the sun passes through <hi>Vrishabha</hi> (Taurus) and <hi>Mithun</hi> (Gemini).

</p><p>Indra (the god of rain), Varuna (the lord of all waters)<corr sic=".">,</corr> V&#257;yu (the god of wind), Agni (the god of fire), and the moon-god are also believed by some to have power over the seasons.<note id="n61.2" n="2">N. D. Vora, Rajpara.</note>
</p><p>The belief is as old as the <hi>Vedas</hi> that demons sometimes obstruct the fall of rain, and confine the waters of the clouds. It is Indra who fights with them and breaks through their castles by means of his thunderbolt, sending down showers of rain for the benefit of his worshippers. So, whenever there is an unusual drought, people still invoke the aid of this god, and celebrate a festival in his honour, called <hi>Ujjani</hi> or <hi>Indramahotsava</hi>. <hi>Homas</hi><note id="n61.a" n="A">Offering oblations to gods by throwing <hi>ghi</hi> into the consecrated fire.</note> are performed to propitiate the god, and Brahmans are entertained at a feast. Sometimes the festival is celebrated outside the village, where people go in large parties to dine together. The usual dish on such an occasion is <hi>Meghl&#257;du</hi> or sweet balls of wheat-flour fried in <hi>ghi</hi>.
</p><p>Another favourite ceremony supposed to cause rain to fall is the submersion of the image of Shiva in water, by blocking up the <hi>kh&#257;l</hi> or passage in the <hi>Shiva-linga</hi> by which water poured over the image usually runs off.<ref type="noteref" target="n61.2">[#2]</ref> This ceremony is known as <hi>Jala-j&#257;tr&#257;</hi>. <hi>Rudr&#257;bhisheka</hi>, or the ceremony of pouring water in a constant stream over the image of Shiva for eleven consecutive days and nights, is sometimes performed with the same object.<note id="n61.3" n="3">D. K. Pandya, Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>Sometimes the assistance of Shringhi <hi>rishi</hi> is invoked to bring about a fall of rain. The <hi>rishi</hi> is installed in water, mantras are recited, and prayers are offered before a sacrificial fire. This ceremony, called <hi>Parjanya-sh&#257;nti</hi>, is said to have been performed within recent years in Bombay, and to have been successful in bringing rain.<note id="n61.4" n="4">The Schoolmaster of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>It is also said that rainfall can be caused by singing a song or a sacred hymn to the <hi>mal&#257;r</hi> tune. There is a tradition that the well-known saint Narsinha Mehta once sang this tune on the occasion of the celebration of the first pregnancy of his daughter, and the performance was immediately followed by a shower of rain. Rain, which is brought down in this manner, can be put a stop to by singing to a different tune.<note id="n61.5" n="5">The Schoolmaster of Upleta.</note>
</p><p>Low-caste women have recourse to the following expedient to bring rain. Five or six of them place a quantity of muddy earth on a wooden stool, which is carried by one of them. The lump of mud is covered with leaves of the <hi>Gidot&#257;n</hi> or <hi>Tindot&#257;n</hi> creeper, and is called <hi>mehulo</hi> or <hi>meghalo</hi>. The whole party then sing songs, and visit every house in the village. A bowl of water is poured over the <hi>mehulo</hi> and the women receive some corn for their trouble.<note id="n61.6" n="6">The Deputy Educational Inspector of Gohelwad and K. D. Desai.</note>
</p><p>Some believe that when the worship of the village-gods is neglected and when the people grow corrupt, ill-treat the saints and are given to the killing of cows and Brahmans, Yama, the God of Death, directs his colleagues, Indra and Varuna, to threaten the world with a drought. The rainfall returns only when the people revert to righteous ways, and after Indra and Varuna have been conciliated by offerings.
</p><p>The lower classes of the people believe a prolonged cessation of rain to be due to the wrath of local minor deities, aroused by the neglect of their worship. In such a contingency, therefore, they prepare <hi>b&#257;klan</hi><note id="n61.b" n="B">A flat round loaf, about two to four inches in <corr sic="diametre">diameter</corr>, prepared from the flour of <hi>u&#7693;ad</hi>.</note> of <pb n="62"/><hi>u&#7693;ad</hi> (lentils), <hi>l&#257;psi</hi>,<note id="n62.a" n="A">Coarse wheat-flour fried in <hi>ghi</hi> and sweetened with sugar or molasses.</note> <hi>vad&#257;n</hi><note id="n62.b" n="B">Bean-flour, generally of gram or peas, is allowed to remain in water with spices, until the paste acquires a sufficient degree of consistency, when it is rolled into small biscuit-sized balls and fried in sweet oil.</note> and other dishes, and offer them to the local gods for their propitiation.<note id="n62.1" n="1">K.

</p><p>To stop an incessant fall of rain, people often observe the <hi>&#256;ladr&#257;</hi> vow. The patel or headman issues a proclamation that on a particular day none should cook, or churn whey, or fetch water, or wash clothes, or attend to any of the multifarious household duties; but that all should pass the day in prayer. A complete cessation from toil in favour of earnest devotion to divine powers are the peculiar features of this vow. People do not abstain from food: but food must be prepared on the previous day. If the rains do not cease in spite of this vow, but threaten the village with inundation, the headman leads a procession to the confines of the village and makes an offering to the waters.<note id="n62.2" n="2">M. M. Rana, Rajkot.</note>

K. Pandya, Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>A cessation of rains is also believed to be brought about by offering an oblation to the god Kasatia, and by the observance of the vow called <hi>Kasatia g&#257;nth</hi> (or tying the knot of Kasatia). The vow lasts for three weeks, and those who observe it do not partake of anything except rice<note id="n62.5" n="5">The Shastri of Jetpur P&#257;thash&#257;l&#257;, and the Schoolmaster of Vanod.</note> (or, according to others, <hi>jir&#257;n</hi>, a kind of spice<note id="n62.6" n="6">The Schoolmaster of Mota Dewalia.

</p><p>Some persons attribute a heavy fall of rain to the wrath of Indra, and offer ceremonious prayers to appease that god.<note id="n62.7" n="7">The Schoolmaster of Ganod.</note> In some places people engage the services of magicians to restrain the fall of rain.<note id="n62.8" n="8">The Schoolmaster of Vanod.</note> Farmers sometimes brand the rain by casting burning sparks upon it in order to stop an incessant fall.<note id="n62.9" n="9">The Shastri of Jetpur P&#257;thash&#257;l&#257;.</note> Vows in honour of <hi>samudra</hi> (the ocean) are also observed with the same object.<ref type="noteref" target="n62.3">[#3]</ref>
</p><p>In the changing circumstances of life, women more readily have recourse to religious vows for the fulfilment of their wishes than men. This fondness of women for vows has brought into vogue a number of vrats or religious observances which are practised by women only. <hi>Gangigor</hi> or <hi>Gan&#257;gor</hi>, <hi>Vat-S&#257;vitri</hi>, <hi>Mol&#257;kat</hi>, <hi>Goutr&#257;t</hi>, <hi>Alavana</hi> or <hi>Alunda</hi>, <hi>Eva-vrat</hi>, <hi>Tulsi-vrat</hi><corr>,</corr> <hi>Um&#257; masheshwar-vrat</hi>, and <hi>Surya-vrat</hi> are instances of such vows.<ref type="noteref" target="n62.1">[#1]</ref> The <hi>Mol&#257;kat-vrat</hi> is observed by virgins from the eleventh to the fifteenth day of the bright half of <hi>&#256;sh&#257;dh</hi>.<note id="n62.10" n="10">The Schoolmaster of Jodia.</note> The <hi>Goutr&#257;t-vrat</hi> is believed to secure male progeny, as well as long life to the husband.

</p><p>On the fourth day of the dark half of <hi>Shr&#257;van</hi>, women observe a <hi>vrat</hi> called <hi>Bolchoth</hi>. In the morning the woman worships <pb n="63"/>a cow and her calf (which must both be of the same colour), applies a little cotton to the horns of the cow, and makes an auspicious mark on the foreheads of both with red lac. She then places an offering of betel and rice before the cow, takes four turns round the pair, and whispers in the ears of the cow the words <hi>t&#257;run satya m&#257;run vritya</hi> (your truth and my devotion). A Br&#257;hman then recites the legend of the <hi>vrat</hi>.<note id="n63.a" n="A">The story tells how a woman and her daughter-in-law, intending to observe this vow, killed and cooked a calf by mistake; covered with shame, they locked themselves up in their house, and refused admission to the neighbours, to whom they confessed their crime.

</p><p>After narrating this story, the Brahman takes the betel and other things placed before the cow.

</p><p>The worship of the goddess R&#257;ndal is a favourite <hi>vrat</hi> with Gujarati women. A bower is erected for the installation of the goddess, and a <hi>b&#257;jat</hi> or a wooden stool is placed therein. A piece of fine cloth is spread on the <hi>b&#257;jat</hi>, and a figure is drawn in seeds of corn. A <hi>kalasio</hi> or bowl, with a cocoanut on it, is placed over the figure. The cocoanut has two eyes painted on it in black collyrium and a nose in red lac, and is decorated with rich clothes and ornaments to represent the goddess R&#257;ndal. Ghi lamps are kept constantly burning before the goddess for three consecutive days and nights. An invitation is sent to the neighbouring women, who bring offerings of ghi to the goddess, and dance in a group at night to the accompaniment of melodious <hi>garabis</hi> (songs).<note id="n63.2" n="2">The Schoolmasters of Vanod and Kolki.</note> Sometimes, if a child is ill, or some misfortune is apprehended, <hi>gor&#257;nis</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, a certain number of unmarried girls and unwidowed women, are invited to a feast in honour of R&#257;ndal.

<pb n="68"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch2" n="II" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER II.</head><head>HEROIC GODLINGS</head><p>Several stories, in addition to the legend of the R&#257;m&#257;yana, are related of the birth of the god Hanum&#257;n. Dasharatha, king of Ayodhy&#257;, being childless, once performed a sacrifice with the hope of thereby obtaining male issue. On the completion of the ceremony a heavenly being rose out of the sacrificial fire and presented the king with a celestial preparation, called <hi>p&#257;yas</hi>, which he directed the king to give to his wives if he desired a son. The king divided the divine gift among his three queens; but the share of one of them was snatched away by an eagle. It was dropped into the hands of <corr sic="Anjani">Anjan&#299;</corr><corr sic=";">,</corr> who was herself childless, and was practising austerities for the sake of obtaining <corr>a </corr>son. On partaking of the <hi>p&#257;yas</hi>, Anjan&#299; conceived, and the son born to her was afterwards known as the god Hanum&#257;n.
</p><p>Another story relates how <corr sic="Anjani">Anjan&#299;</corr> was one of those persons who helped Indra in his evil designs on Ahaly&#257;, the wife of Gautama. She had on that account been cursed by Gautama, and threatened with the birth of a fatherless child. To prevent the curse from taking effect, Anjan&#299; buried herself in the ground as far as her waist, and began to observe religious austerities in the hope of propitiating Shiva. The latter was pleased with her devotion, and sent her a <hi>mantra</hi> through N&#257;rada, who was ordered to deliver it in her ear. V&#257;yu, the god of wind, forced the <hi>mantra</hi> into her womb, and she conceived a son named Hanum&#257;n. This son had the form of a monkey, because, at the time of conception, Anjan&#299; happened to behold a monkey, named Keshi, on a neighbouring tree.

Hence he is known as the conqueror of Panoti. After the death of R&#257;vana, Hanum&#257;n was left to guard the kingdom of Lank&#257;, which was conferred by R&#257;ma on Bibh&#299;shana, the brother of R&#257;vana.<note id="n68.1" n="1">K. D.

</p><p>All <hi>bhuts</hi>, <hi>prets</hi> and spirits are thus believed to obey the commands of the god Hanum&#257;n.

For this purpose the <hi>Hanum&#257;n raksha mantra</hi> is repeated one hundred and eight times before the image of the god, the devotee remaining standing all the time. A lamp of clarified butter is also lighted, and frankincense is burnt.

</p><p>The god Hanum&#257;n is sometimes worshipped when a serious epidemic is to be warded off.

In some places the mere sight of the image of the god has the same effect, and it is believed that ghosts shriek and fly from the bodies of possessed persons, if these visit the images of Hanum&#257;n. In Kodolia, about half a mile to the west of Lilapur in Gujar&#257;t, there is a temple of Hanum&#257;n where persons suffering from fever go on a Saturday, and take a meal before 2 p. m. at which time the god goes out to graze his cows. This proceeding is believed to work a cure in cases of fever and is called <hi>anagah</hi>.<note id="n69.5" n="5">The Schoolmaster of Lilapur.</note> A mere glance at the temple of Hanum&#257;n at Khandia and <pb n="70"/>Saranghur, or of that image which is known as &#8216;Bh&#299;d-bhanjan,&#8217; is sufficient to drive out evil spirits from the bodies of possessed persons.<note id="n70.1" n="1">The Schoolmaster of Songadh.</note> The same virtue is attributed to the images of Hanum&#257;n at Bhurakhia, near Lathi and at Nariana, near Dhrangadhra, in Jhalavar,<note id="n70.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Ganod.</note> Kathiawar.<ref type="noteref" target="n70.2">[#2]</ref>
</p><p>There are certain peculiar conjunctions of planets, which if they appear in a person&#8217;s horoscope, always bring him misfortunes.

In order to counteract the evil effects of <hi>panoti</hi>, people worship Hanum&#257;n as the god who crushed the malignant goddess Panoti under his feet.

</p><p>Oil which has been poured over the image of Hanum&#257;n and caught in a vessel is called <hi>naman</hi>.

</p><p>Bh&#299;ma the second of the P&#257;ndavas was begotten from Kunti by V&#257;yu, the god of <pb n="71"/>wind, and hence was called V&#257;yusuta.

Every day he consumed 12 <hi>kalashis</hi><note id="n71.a" n="A">A <hi>gh&#257;ni</hi> is that quantity of oil seeds which is put in at one time to be crushed in an oil mill.</note> (or 192 maunds) of corn, and as much oil as is yielded by 13 <hi>gh&#257;nis</hi>.<ref type="noteref" target="n71.a">[#A]</ref> He also required a maund and a quarter of betelnuts after each dinner. These habits had procured him the name of Vrikodara, <hi>i.e.</hi>, wolf-bellied. He played a very important part in the Great War, and on the last day of the battle smashed the thigh of Duryodhana with his ponderous mace. In his early days he killed several demons including Baka and Hidimba.<note id="n71.1" n="1">K. D. Desai.</note>
</p><p>Bh&#299;ma never took food without first worshipping Mah&#257;dev. On one occasion no temple of Shiva could be found within easy distance, and in a rage, Bh&#299;ma turned his bowl upside down and set it up as Mah&#257;dev. Such was the first installation of Bh&#299;man&#257;th Mah&#257;dev revered to this day by all Hindus.<ref type="noteref" target="n71.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>Once upon a time Bh&#299;ma obstructed the stream of a river by laying himself across it, when the river rose to the banks and submerged a temple of Shiva near by. Shiva thereupon assumed the form of a lion and pretended to chase P&#257;rvat&#299; in the guise of a cow. Bh&#299;ma, in his true Kshatriya spirit, instantly rose from the water in order to save the cow from the lion. But the latter gave Bh&#299;ma a blow on the shoulder with one of his paws, and instantly transformed himself into a sage. After Bh&#299;ma had fruitlessly searched for the lion for a long time, he was informed by the sage that it was he, Shiva, who had assumed the form of a lion in order to rouse him from his position across the river. Shiva then favoured him with a boon that the half of his body which had received the blow would be turned into <hi>vajra</hi> (adamant). On Bh&#299;ma&#8217;s request a further boon was granted to him that he should in future be able to digest as much as he could eat without suffering discomfort. Hence the proverb: <hi>Bh&#299;ma kh&#257;ve shakuni aghe</hi>.<note id="n71.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Aman.</note>
</p><p>It is said that Bh&#299;ma once played at <hi>navateri</hi> (lit. nine and thirteen), <hi>i.e.</hi>, he flung into the sky nine elephants with his right hand and thirteen with his left. The corpses of these animals were afterwards brought down to earth by Shukamuni to expiate king Janmejaya&#8217;s sin of <hi>Brahmahaty&#257;</hi> (Br&#257;hman-slaughter).<ref type="noteref" target="n71.2">[#2]</ref>

On this day people who desire to be cured of dyspepsia observe a strict fast, taking neither food nor water, and pass their hands over their bellies repeating the name of Bh&#299;ma and also offer cocoanuts to his image.<note id="n71.3" n="3">The Shastri of Jetpur P&#257;thash&#257;l&#257;.</note> On the night of <hi>Bh&#299;ma-agi&#257;ras</hi>, persons who are anxious to obtain health, wealth and victory over their enemies, bathe the image of Bh&#299;ma in water and <hi>panch&#257;mrit</hi><note id="n71.b" n="B">A mixture of milk, honey, curds, sugar and ghi.</note> and worship it according to the prescribed ceremonies.<note id="n71.4" n="4">The Schoolmaster of Rajpara.</note>

The goldsmith satisfied the wishes of the god and was soon relieved from the repeated taunt of the <hi>v&#257;nzi&#257;pan&#257;</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi>, the barrenness of his wife).<note id="n72.5" n="5">The Schoolmaster of Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>The following tradition is connected with a place, about a mile from Dhhank, called Dhhank-ni Fui. Dhhank was in ancient times a great city and was known as <hi>Preh P&#257;tan</hi><note id="n72.b" n="B"><hi>Vide</hi> Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. VIII, page 414.</note>. Once a <hi>b&#257;v&#257;</hi> (recluse), named Dhundhalimal, came to reside with his <hi>chel&#257;</hi> (disciple) in a cave on a neighbouring hill. Every day the <hi>chel&#257;</hi> went about the city begging alms for himself and his <hi>guru</hi>; but nobody except a poor <hi>kumbh&#257;ran</hi> (a potter-woman) ever gave him anything. So the <hi>chel&#257;</hi> was obliged to cut and sell fuel in order to obtain means of subsistence, although he did not mention this fact to his <hi>guru</hi>. One day the <hi>guru</hi> noticed the growing baldness of his disciple and on being questioned about it, the latter had to admit his difficulties in earning a livelihood. The next day the <hi>b&#257;v&#257;</hi> decided to test the charity of the neighbourhood, and went on a begging round in person. He moved about the city from door to door, crying aloud <hi>&#257;lek &#257;lek</hi>, but nobody except the <hi>kumbh&#257;r</hi> woman offered him so much as a handful of flour. He then addressed the latter thus:&#8212;&#8220;Girl, this city is sinful and will shortly meet with destruction. Fly, therefore, instantly with your family and never turn your face towards the city in your flight&#8221;. Having thus warned the only righteous person in the city, the <hi>b&#257;v&#257;</hi> returned to his cave where, after reciting an incantation in high exasperation, he pronounced a terrible curse for the destruction of the city &#8216;Let P&#257;tan be buried and let <hi>m&#257;y&#257;</hi><note id="n72.c" n="C"><hi>M&#257;y&#257;</hi>, in philosophy, means the illusion, by virtue of which<corr sic=","/> one considers the unreal universe as existent and distinct from the supreme spirit.

The <hi>kumbh&#257;ran</hi> had already fled with her children; but she unfortunately happened to look back in her flight, in spite of the warning, and she and her children were all turned into stones. In this form she can be seen even to-day, with two of her children on her shoulders and leading the other two.
<pb n="73"/></p><p>To the south of the same village on the banks of a small lake are situated the temples of Hinglaj M&#257;t&#257; and K&#257;mdev Mah&#257;dev. If there is a prospect of a drought in any year, the people of the village make an offering of <hi>l&#257;psi</hi> to the former deity in order to bring about a fall of rain. About two miles from Dhhank there is a temple of Vikani, in whose honour vows are observed for the cure of fractured bones of men and animals. Br&#257;hmans are feasted at the temple of Hanum&#257;n at Timbo, four miles away from Dhhank. At a distance of about two <hi>khetarv&#257;s</hi> (fields) there is the shrine of Ashabi-pir where Mussalm&#257;ns feast <hi>fakirs</hi> and other co-religionists of theirs.<note id="n73.1" n="1">The Schoolmaster of Dhhank.</note>
</p><p>Besides the above there are the temples of Shankar Tapakeshwar Mah&#257;dev and Mungeshwar Mah&#257;dev near the hill mentioned in the paragraph above and the temples of Pipaleshwar Mah&#257;dev and R&#257;mchandraji, to the south of Dhhank. There are also temples erected in honour of <hi>suttees</hi> known as Nomalm&#257;t&#257;, Hulm&#257;t&#257;, etc.<ref type="noteref" target="n73.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>The river Vinu meets the Bh&#257;dar, at a place two miles to the east of Ganod, and the Moja also joins the Bh&#257;dar a little further to the east. Hence the spot is called <hi>Traveni</hi> (a confluence of three rivers) and is regarded as holy. The beautiful temple of Baraneshwar Mah&#257;dev is situated here. Vows for feasting a certain number of Br&#257;hmans, are observed in honour of this deity.<note id="n73.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>The celebrated shrine of Husen-pir is situated in the vicinity of Ganod, and is much revered by the Khoja community, who hold a fair there on every <hi>&#256;so-sud-bij</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi> the second day of the bright half of &#256;shvin. The fair lasts for seven or eight days, when Khojas from Bombay and even Zanzibar visit the place. A large building, the Khoja-khana, is set apart to the west of the shrine for the <hi>sabh&#257;</hi> (or meeting). The largest fair was held in <hi>samvat 1940</hi> (1884 A.D.), when H. H. the Agashah paid a visit to the shrine. There is a large gathering of people at the place every <hi>bij</hi> day.<ref type="noteref" target="n73.2">[#2]</ref>
</p><p><corr sic="Husen-pir">Husen-p&#299;r</corr> was a native of Kadi and a Saiyed by birth. In his youth, with his father&#8217;s permission, he decided to remain unmarried, and took to travelling. In the course of his wanderings he halted for a week on the spot where his shrine stands at present, and was so charmed with the place, that he asked the owner of it, a Rab&#257;ri, Almora by name, for permission to reside there always. The P&#299;r was accompanied by two followers of the Muj&#257;var fakir sect. The present Muj&#257;var attendants at the shrine are descended from them, and stand in the 12th or the 15th degree of descent.<ref type="noteref" target="n73.2">[#2]</ref>
</p><p>One evening (it was the 5th day of the dark half of Bh&#257;drapad) the P&#299;r accompanied by his two followers went to the Bh&#257;dar to offer the evening prayers. After the prayers were over, he told his followers that a flood was soon coming in the river, and asked both of them to leave him and return with their horses. One of them left the place as directed: but the other placed his head on the P&#299;r&#8217;s lap and was drowned along with his master in the flood, which came down as if in obedience to the P&#299;r&#8217;s words. Before dying the P&#299;r granted a boon to the Muj&#257;vars that their line of descent would never fail for want of their heirs, and that their heirs would always be his attendants.<ref type="noteref" target="n73.2">[#2]</ref>
</p><p>The same night the P&#299;r informed the Khojas of Keshod and Kutiana that his corpse and that of his Muj&#257;var follower lay unburied at a particular spot. The Khojas, accompanied by the Rab&#257;ri Almora, visited the place in the morning and made ready to carry the corpses to Jun&#257;gadh. They found to their astonishment that the corpses could not be removed. Almora then recollected the request of the P&#299;r, and told the Khojas of his favourite place. The corpses were then carried to their present place of rest, and all efforts of the Khojas to proceed further <pb n="74"/>proved unavailing. At that time there was a village called Keralun about a mile from the present site of Ganod. It is, however, uninhabited and in ruins and its site is now known as the <hi>timbo</hi> of Keralun. The Khojas erected a shrine over the place where the P&#299;r was buried, and the tombs of his relatives were afterwards erected in the vicinity. Vows observed in honour of the P&#299;r having proved fruitful in many cases, the P&#299;r&#8217;s fame spreads wider every day. The Gondal Durbar has granted a <hi>w&#257;di</hi> (a piece of land) for the maintenance of the Muj&#257;var family, who also receive the things that are offered to the P&#299;r. The Khojas consider it a merit to dedicate a portion of their earnings to this P&#299;r. People of all castes from Ganod offer one <hi>kori</hi><note id="n74.a" n="A"><hi>Kori</hi> may mean either a new garment or an unused earthen jar.</note> at the time of the marriage of a girl at their house. The knots of the marriage-scarves of newly-wedded couples are untied here, and the ceremony of shaving children for the first time is also performed in the presence of the P&#299;r. The usual offering to the P&#299;r consists of <hi>churamu</hi> and <hi>kans&#257;r</hi>: some people, however, offer a goat or a ram and call it <hi>p&#257;nechedn&#257;riel</hi>.<note id="n74.1" n="1">The Schoolmaster of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>There is a hollow log of wood on the boundary of Lath, a sub-village of Gondal and a mile to the South of Ganod. Long ago a fakir, while accompanying a band of outlaws <hi>b&#257;rvatias</hi>, was killed in a scuffle and was buried here. A <hi>b&#257;bul</hi> tree grew over his tomb, and came to be known afterwards as Lakkad P&#299;r (the wooden <corr sic="Pir">P&#299;r</corr>). The tree after a time withered till its stem was reduced to a small log with a hole in the centre. People observe vows in honour of this <corr sic="Pir">P&#299;r</corr> for the cure of cough and bronchitis in children. After recovery, the children are made to pass through this <hi>b&#257;k&#257;n</hi> or hole and an offering of <hi>kans&#257;r</hi> is made to the P&#299;r. It is not only the Musalm&#257;ns who observe vows in the P&#299;r&#8217;s honour: Hindus also have the same strong faith in him.<ref type="noteref" target="n74.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>Nearly twelve miles from Vanod lies the temple of Bechr&#257; M&#257;t&#257;, who is the patron goddess of the P&#257;vaiy&#257; sect. A male buffalo is offered to her as a victim on the 15th day of the bright half of every month. Near the temple there is the holy <hi>kund</hi> of M&#257;nsarovar, the legend about which has already been related in these notes<corr>.</corr><note id="n74.b" n="B">See p. 42 <hi>Supra</hi>.</note>
</p><p>The village of D&#257;dvi possesses the shrine of Mangalsh&#257; P&#299;r. Friday is the day for special worship of the P&#299;r, when dainties and cocoanuts are offered, and a flag is hoisted. Frankincense is burnt every evening.<note id="n74.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Dadvi.</note> There is also a temple of M&#257;chho, the goddess of the Bharv&#257;ds, who offer her <hi>l&#257;psi</hi> and cocoanuts on every <hi>bij</hi> day.

</p><p>In Kolki a <hi>b&#257;v&#257;</hi> of the Bharv&#257;d caste named Hado Bhagat is said to have set up the images of all the gods in a certain temple.

</p><p>In the village of Mot&#257; Devali&#257; are the temples of Bhol&#257;n&#257;th, Mah&#257;dev and Pipaleshwar Mah&#257;dev. Both the deities are worshipped by Atits, who perform the ceremony with the usual materials of frankincense, a ghi-lamp, cooked food, and who also blow a conch. It is said about Pipaleshwar Mah&#257;dev that none can stay at night in the temple. Once a Br&#257;hman, who insisted on passing the night there, was hurled to a <pb n="75"/>distance of two fields. There is also a temple of Sw&#257;mi-N&#257;r&#257;yan and three temples of Th&#257;korji where the ceremony of worship is performed every morning and evening in the usual way with frankincense, a ghi lamp, and <hi>&#257;rati</hi>.

</p><p>A temple of Khodiar M&#257;t&#257; surrounded by Pandari creepers is to be seen on the way from Mojidad to Sanka. The Thakor of Limbdi used to kill a goat before the goddess during the Navar&#257;tra holidays; but an offering of <hi>l&#257;psi</hi> is now substituted for the goat. There is another temple of the same goddess on the way to Z&#257;b&#257;l&#257; where she is worshipped by the Bhadkav&#257; Durbar.

</p><p>Every marriage-procession on its way to and from the place of marriage has to offer a new earthen jar to such field-deities as D&#257;dmokhodiar, L&#257;lo, Hard&#257;s, etc. Failure to do so arouses the wrath of these deities and brings disasters to the married couple. The only form of worship in use for these deities is to apply red lead and oil to their images. Seven kinds of corn, <hi>viz.</hi> <hi>ad&#257;d</hi> (phaseolus radiatus), <hi>mag</hi> (phaseolus mungo), <hi>kalathi</hi>, <hi>math</hi>, <hi>chan&#257;</hi> (gram), wheat and <hi>juvari</hi> are mixed and cooked together and the preparation which is called <hi>khichdi</hi> is offered to the deities at sunset.

</p><p>The village of Aman possesses the holy tomb of Davalshah P&#299;r. This P&#299;r lived in the 15th century and was a native of Ahmedabad. He had come to serve in the Amaran <hi>th&#257;na</hi>, when he was killed in a battle. A tomb was built over his body, and he soon came to be regarded as a P&#299;r. His name became famous when a blind Bharv&#257;d regained his eye-sight through his favour. The P&#299;r also gave a son to a Bania from Ahmedabad who visits the tomb every year in a black suit. Once a Miana killed a cow and took refuge at the shrine of this P&#299;r: but the shrine spontaneously caught fire and he was burnt with it. The present building was erected by the Bania, and the ladies of the Jamsaheb&#8217;s court have supplied silver gates and copper railings to it. The Jamsaheb also presents <hi>kinkhab</hi> coverings for the tomb every year.

</p><p>Charadwa is well-known for the temple of R&#257;jeshwari M&#257;t&#257;. King Prithwi R&#257;j Choh&#257;n suffered from white leprosy and was once going to Dw&#257;rk&#257;, with the hope that residence in the holy city would cure him of his disease. On the way, one of his best bullocks suddenly fell. The animal was almost given up for dead when a young woman named R&#257;jb&#257;i, daughter of Ud&#257; Ch&#257;ran, happened to pass by while carrying water in earthen pots. R&#257;jb&#257;i touched the bullock with one of her toes, and to the astonishment of all beholders, the animal at once got up. Prithwi R&#257;j got rid of his leprosy by the favour of R&#257;jb&#257;i, who granted him an additional boon that she would come to help him on another occasion if he remembered her and sought her assistance. R&#257;jb&#257;i then directed him to visit Dw&#257;rk&#257;. Long after, king Prithwi R&#257;j, when he was at his own place, remembered her in a moment of distress, and she went there (in spirit) after giving instructions to her relatives not to dispose of her body, as she would return soon. But the relatives did not understand her, and before she had returned from Prithwi <corr sic="R&#257;j&#257;&#8217;s">R&#257;j&#8217;s</corr> place, her body was disposed of according to the usual manner. For this, R&#257;jb&#257;i cursed her relatives that one of their descendants in each degree would turn out a lunatic. In her memory a pillar was raised and an image set up, both of which are worshipped every morning and evening. Milk, sugar and cakes are offered to her every morning in a <hi>th&#257;l</hi> or dish, and milk and sugar every evening.

The ceremony of <hi>&#257;rati</hi> is performed before the images five times every day. The first is called <hi>mangal&#257;rati</hi> or the auspicious <hi>&#257;rati</hi> and is performed early in the morning. The second is <hi>Shang&#257;r (Shring&#257;r) &#257;rati</hi>, when night garments are taken off the images and new ones are put on for the day. The third <hi>R&#257;jbhog &#257;rati</hi>, takes place at the time when dainties and cooked food are offered to the gods. The <hi>Sandhy&#257; &#257;rati</hi> follows the offering of milk, sugar and cakes to the gods in the evening. The last, <hi>Pidh&#257;n &#257;rati</hi>, is performed at night, when night garments are substituted for the rich dresses of the day.

At that time the queen of the reigning prince of P&#257;tan could not be delivered of a child even though two years had passed since the time of conception. Once while on tour the queen&#8217;s party encamped near the <hi>nehado</hi> of Zunz&#257; Bharv&#257;d. The latter, when he learnt of the queen&#8217;s misfortune, said that the co-wives of the queen had bewitched her by the <hi>k&#257;man</hi> art, <hi>i.e.</hi>, by passing an earthen pot round her and by burying the pot underground with a live frog hanging with its head downwards in it. He added that the queen would not be delivered unless the frog was brought out by some stratagem. He asked the queen and her followers to stay there for some time, and sent word to P&#257;tan with a messenger that the queen was delivered of a son. The co-wives of the queen, dismayed at the unexpected news and at the futility of the <hi>k&#257;man</hi> art, went to look at the buried frog, which instantly jumped out and at the same moment the pregnant queen gave birth to a son. As the child was brought to birth by the instructions of a <hi>Siddha-purusha</hi> (a magician), it was named Siddhar&#257;j. The town of Zinzuwada was built in memory of Zunz&#257; Bharv&#257;d, and a temple of R&#257;jb&#257;i M&#257;t&#257; was erected in honour of the queen. A large lake named Sens&#257;sar was also constructed in memory of Sens&#257;, the brother of Zunz&#257;.<note id="n77.3" n="3">The Schoolmaster of Zinzuwada.</note>
</p><p>Soon afterwards people began to observe vows in honour of R&#257;jb&#257;i M&#257;t&#257;. The devotees of the goddess visit her temple every evening. All newly-married couples in the village offer salutations to the M&#257;t&#257; accompanied by hired musicians and a party of women who sing on the way to the shrine. A virgin walks in front of the party with an earthen pot and a cocoanut on her head. After the salutations, sweetmeats to the amount vowed for are distributed among all those who are present. Sometimes a woman who has observed vows for the sake of a son, <pb n="78"/>presents a silver umbrella to the goddess, of the value of one rupee and a quarter or five rupees and a quarter, on the birth of a son to her. Burnt offerings and <hi>l&#257;psi</hi> are presented to the goddess to protect the town from such misfortunes as cholera, plague, etc.<note id="n78.1" n="1">The Schoolmaster of Zinzuwada.</note>
</p><p>There is a well-known place called V&#257;chhd&#257;-solanki about eight miles front Zinzuwada. Once a Rajput boy, aged sixteen, was going round the marriage-altar at the time of his wedding, in the village of Kuar, when he heard a piteous cry from a distressed cowherd, whose cows were being carried away by freebooters. The boy immediately ran to rescue the cows; but he was killed in the encounter. A temple was built on that spot in his honour. There is a small <hi>kund</hi> near the temple, the water in which is believed never to dry up and to possess the quality of curing hydrophobia.
</p><p>Goradia Hanum&#257;n lies three miles from Zinzuwada, and there is a tradition that there is a treasure hidden near by. Many vows are observed in honour of Dham&#257; Hanum&#257;n, whose place is at a distance of two miles from Zinzuwada.<ref type="noteref" target="n78.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>The holy <hi>kund</hi> of Zil&#257;nand is one mile from Zinzuwada. It is a custom of the neighbourhood to throw the bones of deceased persons into this <hi>kund</hi>, and a fair is held annually at the place on the last day of Bh&#257;drapad. The Bhot&#257;vo <hi>kund</hi> is one mile distant from Zil&#257;nand <hi>kund</hi>: the bottom of this <hi>kund</hi> presents a bluish appearance, and the water always remains hot. It is said that there are sulphur mines below.<ref type="noteref" target="n78.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>A princess of Marwar used to worship five gods: Sumaria Ganesh, <corr sic="Kanaknath">Kanakn&#257;th</corr>, Ratneshwar Mah&#257;dev, N&#257;gn&#257;th and Hanum&#257;n; and she had taken a vow never to take food before she had worshipped all of them. The gods followed her everywhere in all her tours, but they had made one condition, that they would stop if she looked behind at them on the way. The princess happened to look back at Ganpati on the ridge of Sumaria near Keshia, three miles to the east of Jodia. So Ganpati would not leave Sumaria, and was installed there as Sumaria Ganesh. The same happened to Ratneshwar near Badanpur; to Kanakn&#257;th, at a place midway between Kanakpuri (the modern Kunad) and Badanpur; and to Hanum&#257;n, near Kunad. In the same manner, N&#257;gn&#257;th was installed near the Balambha gate of Jodia. The old town of Kanakpuri was buried by an earth-quake, and the image Kunadia Hanum&#257;n was found among its ruins.
</p><p>The attendants of Sumaria Ganesh are At&#299;ts. A fair is held there on the 4th day of Vaish&#257;kh, when thousands of Dheds flock to the place. The usual offering to the god consists of sweet balls. Kanakn&#257;th is attended upon by At&#299;t B&#257;v&#257;s who share among themselves whatever is offered to the god. Shaivas hold a fair here on the 8th day of the dark half of Shr&#257;van.
</p><p>The devotees of Kunadia Hanum&#257;n observe <hi>anagh</hi> (vulgarly called <hi>anagodha</hi>) at his place on Saturdays. They cook their food there and make offerings to the god before partaking of it, fasting afterwards for the day. The <hi>anagh</hi> is observed in the month of M&#257;rgash&#299;rsha. The attendants of this god are Kh&#257;khi B&#257;v&#257;s.<note id="n78.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Jodia.</note>
</p><p>One mile to the north-west of Jodia, towards the sea, there is a stone image of a horse set up on a pedestal, known as R&#257;val P&#299;r. A heroic Gir&#257;sia of the D&#257;l sect, named R&#257;val, was once shipwrecked while on an expedition from Cutch, and is said to have landed at the spot where R&#257;val P&#299;r stands at present. He received a hearty reception at the hands of the then ruling prince of Jodia (who was a Khav&#257;s) and was installed in the Durb&#257;r as Nana R&#257;val P&#299;r.
</p><p>On the second day of the bright half of &#256;sh&#257;dh (which is the new year&#8217;s day <pb n="79"/>according to the Halari year) Hindus offer <hi>l&#257;psi</hi> to R&#257;val P&#299;r as also on each Monday in the month of Bh&#257;drapad. On occasions of popular distress, such as the breaking out of cholera or when the rains stop for days together, the <hi><corr sic="bhuw&#257;s">bhuv&#257;s</corr></hi> at the place, who are D&#257;l Rajputs, receive the <hi>pedi</hi> (a small heap of <hi>l&#257;psi</hi>) on behalf of the P&#299;r, and being possessed, declare the will of the P&#299;r as to when rain may be expected or when an epidemic will be warded off. Persons who are anxious for the success of their undertakings observe vows in honour of the P&#299;r which may cost them anything from a single pice to twenty-five rupees. At the shrine of N&#257;n&#257; R&#257;val P&#299;r, huge kettledrums are beaten and the ceremony of <hi>&#257;rati</hi> is performed every morning and evening.<note id="n79.1" n="1">The Schoolmaster of Goda.</note>
</p><p>The present site of Lilapur was formerly uninhabited, and the village stood nearly one mile off. Once the goddess Bhav&#257;n&#299; directed the <hi>patel</hi> of the village in a dream to reside on the present site, and promised him that he would be always happy and that none of his descendants for seven generations would die of cholera. In testimony of the reality of the dream a box of red lac, a cocoanut, a reel of red thread&#8212;called <hi>n&#257;d&#257;s&#257;di</hi> and <hi>chunadi</hi>&#8212;were found under the patel&#8217;s pillow. The village was then removed to its present site. The descendants of the patel are called Yadod&#257;. The M&#257;t&#257; chose to take a Bharv&#257;d to be her attendant. On the 15th day of the bright half of Shr&#257;van offerings are burnt before the M&#257;t&#257;, when the attendant <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> has to offer sweetmeats worth five rupees. Every Bharv&#257;d family spends a rupee and a quarter every third year in honour of the M&#257;t&#257;.
</p><p>During the famine of the year 1895 Samvat era (= 1839 <hi rend="sc">A. D.</hi>) the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> was thinking of leaving the M&#257;t&#257; in order to escape from starvation, when the goddess appeared in a dream to him, and told him that he would find half a rupee every morning in the temple until he saw and partook of the new harvest. In the month of Shr&#257;van, he happened to partake of some new seeds and the coin could not be found as usual after this, although the new harvest was not quite ready till three months afterwards. At the entreaties of the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi>, however, the M&#257;t&#257; again told him in a dream that he would find a silver anklet, weighing 60 <hi>tolas</hi>, on the <hi>bhogav&#257;</hi> (village boundary) of the village of Shiyani. A number of vows are observed in honour of this goddess with various motives.<note id="n79.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Lilapur.</note>

</p><p>About ten years ago Un&#257;d Bhagat and Jiv&#257; Bhagat of Paliad were one day walking together, when Un&#257;d Bhagat collected seven stones and placing them one over the other, said to Jiv&#257; Bhagat that he was constructing a <hi>p&#257;lio</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, a tomb for Jiv&#257;. Immediately Jiv&#257; died, and Un&#257;d had to carry out what was merely meant in jest. Some rooms are built at the expense of the Jasdan Durbar, and a <hi>puj&#257;ri</hi> daily offers worship to Jiv&#257; Bhagat. A fair is also held in his honour on the second day of Bh&#257;drapad.<note id="n79.3" n="3">The Schoolmaster of Jasdan.</note>
</p><p>About two miles from Jasdan in the village of Bakhalvad there is a temple of &#256;vad M&#257;t&#257;. The latter represents the queen of one of the rulers of Jasdan. On every Vijay&#257;-dasham&#299;, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the 10th day of the <pb n="80"/>bright half of Ashvin, the prince of Jasdan goes to visit the image in a procession, offers <hi>l&#257;psi</hi> to &#256;vad M&#257;t&#257;, and then a feast is celebrated. Formerly it was the custom to kill a buffalo before the goddess on this day: but only <hi>l&#257;psi</hi> is now offered instead. It is usual to take some wine also on this occasion.<note id="n80.1" n="1">The Schoolmaster of Jasdan.</note>
</p><p>On the Chitalia hill, two miles from Jasdan, there is a temple of Shital&#257;, the goddess of small-pox, where children who have lately recovered from that disease are taken to offer salutations to the goddess. Silver images of human eye, milk, sugar, curds, grapes, cocoanuts, a sheet of blank paper, and a number of other things are presented to the goddess on such an occasion. Some persons vow to visit the goddess with a burning hearth on their heads. Such vows are discharged on a <hi>s&#257;tem</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the 7th day of the bright or the dark half of a month. On Shili S&#257;tem, the 7th day of the dark half of Shr&#257;van, there is a large gathering of people at the place.<ref type="noteref" target="n80.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>The village-gods of Upleta are Kaleshwar, Pragateshwar, Somn&#257;th, N&#299;lkanth, D&#257;dmo and Khetalio. Pragateshwar is said to have emerged from the earth of his own accord and is therefore called <hi>Swayambhu</hi> (self-existent). The same is said about N&#299;lkanth and Somn&#257;th also. The temple of D&#257;dmo lies a little away from Upleta. Persons suffering from cough observe vows in his honour and partake of parched gram. There is a <hi>devi</hi> near Pragateshwar before whom a sacrifice is performed on the 9th day of the bright half of Ashvin, and cakes, bread, <hi>khichdi</hi> and <hi>khir</hi> are offered.<note id="n80.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Upleta.</note>
</p><p>In Gondal there is a temple of Gondalio N&#257;g and one of N&#257;gn&#257;th Mah&#257;dev. Pure milk is the usual offering made to both the deities. Gondalio N&#257;g is installed in Durb&#257;rgadh and is white in appearance. Newly married couples of high class Hindus untie the knots of their marriage-scarves before this deity. In the Durb&#257;rgadh there are tombs of seven <hi>ghoris</hi> with whose assistance the first king of Gondal is said to have won his crown.

</p><p>There is a female spirit named Meldi in Movaiya who is worshipped by <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> on the 14th day of the dark half of Ashv&#299;n. On that day they heat oil in an iron pan and take out cakes from the burning oil with unprotected hands. A goat and a cock are also sacrificed on this occasion, and the meat is partaken of in order to win the favour of the goddess.<note id="n80.4" n="4">The Schoolmaster of Movaiya.</note>
</p><p>There is a <hi>bed&#257;</hi> tree near Movaiya about which the following story is told. Long ago there was a <hi>kanbi</hi> (farmer) in Movaiya who used to see a boy moving in front of him with an uncovered head whenever he was ploughing his field. One day the <hi>kanbi</hi> lopped off the hair from the boy&#8217;s head who followed him to his home, entreating him to return the lock of hair. The <hi>kanbi</hi> however did not heed him, and concealed the lock of hair in a jar containing gram. The boy then served the <hi>kanbi</hi> as a field-boy, when one day he was asked by his master to take gram out of the jar for sowing. The boy, who was a <hi>bhut</hi>, found his lock of hair there, and when once he had obtained it, he took a very heavy load of gram to the <hi>kanbi</hi> and bade him good-bye. But before the boy had fled with his lock of hair, the <hi>kanbi</hi> begged of him a boon that a <hi>bed&#257;</hi> tree should grow in his field, where vows could be observed in honour of the <hi>bhut</hi>.<ref type="noteref" target="n80.4">[#4]</ref>
</p><p>The villagers in Sayala accompanied by several <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> and by musicians who beat the <hi>dhols</hi> and the <hi>d&#257;nkl&#257;n</hi> go outside the village <pb n="81"/>to visit the temple of Khodi&#257;r M&#257;t&#257; on the 15th day of the bright half of Shr&#257;van. The <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> wind a piece of cotton-thread round the village, and sometimes pour out milk or water in the same place in order to secure its safety from any epidemic. On the same occasion four divers, who are generally healthy young athletes, are presented with an earthen pot each and are made to stand in the village-tank till the water reaches to their necks. They are asked to dive simultaneously in the water at a signal from the headman of the village, and to get out immediately. Each of them is named after one of the four months of the rainy season and the amount of water in the pot of each is supposed to indicate the amount of rain which would fall in the respective months of the next year. After leaving the water the divers break the pots on the spot, and the fragments are taken away by the people, to be kept in their jars of corn, in the belief that they will bring prosperity in the ensuing season. The four divers are then made to run a race on the <hi>maidan</hi>, and he who wins the race gets a small plough and a cocoanut as a prize. The winner is called <hi>h&#257;lino-jityo</hi>, and it is believed that he will be successful in all his undertakings.
</p><p>On the same day the <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> place a small four-wheeled chariot of the M&#257;t&#257; outside the village, and it is believed that the chariot carries off the plague, cholera and similar diseases with it. Such ceremonies are performed in most of the villages on the Balev holiday (<hi>i.e.</hi>, the N&#257;rel-Purnim&#257; day, or the 15th day of the bright half of Shr&#257;van).<note id="n81.1" n="1">The Schoolmaster of Sayala.</note>
</p><p>The foundation of a new settlement is carried out in various ways. A series of unusual accidents befalling the residents of a village makes them doubtful of the security of their residence, and produces a desire to move to a safer home. Very often on such occasions the <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> or exorcists are possessed by the Devis, or M&#257;t&#257;s, and declare the will of the gods regarding a new settlement. Sometimes a change of home is recommended <corr sic="tot he">to the</corr> villagers in a dream: sometimes a heavenly voice is said to direct the change, in addressing one of the villagers.<note id="n81.2" n="2">K. D. Desai.</note>
</p><p>An astrologer has first to be consulted as to the auspicious date on which the boundaries of the new settlement should be marked out. Three or four days before the delimitation, learned Brahmans are sent to purify the chosen site by the recitation of sacred mantras.<note id="n81.3" n="3">The Schoolmaster of Khirasara.</note> On the appointed day the headman of the village leads a procession to the site, and performs the ceremony of installing the village gods. It is said that, at the time of founding a new settlement, it is necessary to install and worship the <hi>panch-deva</hi> or the five deities, namely, Hanum&#257;n, Ganpati, Mah&#257;dev, Vishnu and Devi. Hanum&#257;n is installed at the village-gates, and is propitiated with an offering of <hi>churmu</hi> and <hi>vad&#257;n</hi>. The images of Ganpati and Vishnu are set up in a central place in the village, temples being built for them in due curse. Mah&#257;dev is generally installed on the village-boundary, and has a temple built for him afterwards. Devi may be set up anywhere: her installation is not permanent nor does she receive systematic worship.<note id="n81.4" n="4">The Schoolmaster of Chhatrasa.</note> But more generally only Ganpati, Hanum&#257;n and M&#257;t&#257; are installed on this occasion.<note id="n81.5" n="5">The Schoolmasters of Jodia and Khirasara.</note> Occasionally other deities, such as the Earth, Shesh N&#257;g,<note id="n81.a" n="A">The celebrated serpent of one thousand heads who supports all the worlds.</note> the Navagrah (the nine planets), the pole-star and Kshetrap&#257;l are also worshipped.<note id="n81.6" n="6">The Schoolmaster of Rajpara.</note>
</p><p>The village-gates are fixed after the ceremony of installation, and a <hi>tora&#7751;</hi>&#8212;a string of <hi>&#257;sop&#257;lav</hi> leaves (Jonesia asoka) with a cocoanut in the centre&#8212;is fastened across them <pb n="82"/>near the top.<note id="n82.1" n="1">The Schoolmasters of Chhatrasa and Rajpara.</note> Here the ceremony of <hi>kh&#257;t-muhurt</hi><note id="n82.a" n="A"><hi>Vide</hi> Chapter I<corr sic="."/>, p. 29.</note> is performed<note id="n82.2" n="2">The Shastri of Jetpur P&#257;thash&#257;l&#257;.</note> and afterwards the headman, accompanied by a Brahman, who recites mantras, either winds a cotton-thread besmeared with red lac round the village or pours a stream of milk <hi>dh&#257;r&#257;v&#257;di</hi> along the village boundaries.<note id="n82.3" n="3">The Schoolmasters of Khirasara, Jetpur and Rajpara.</note> The headman has further to perform the <hi>homa</hi> at the gates of the village, when a company of Brahmans recite holy passages in honour of Hanum&#257;n and M&#257;t&#257;. At the time of the completion of the homa, when the <hi>&#257;huti</hi> (an oblation of ghi) is thrown on the fire, all persons present offer cocoanuts to the sacrificial fire.<note id="n82.4" n="4">The Schoolmasters of Chhatrasa and Jetpur<corr>.</corr></note>
</p><p>In some places it is usual to worship the newly chosen site itself, and then to drive into the ground a wooden peg besmeared with red lac, called the <hi>khili</hi> (peg) of Shesh N&#257;g, which is first ceremoniously worshipped with red lac, sandal-ointment and rice.<note id="n82.5" n="5">The Schoolmaster of Jodia.</note>
</p><p>After these ceremonies, the villagers are at liberty to build their own houses within the new settlement. When the houses are complete and ready for habitation, it is necessary to perform the ceremony known as <hi>v&#257;stun</hi> (or <hi>graha-sh&#257;nti</hi>) for the propitiation of the nine planets. Both the day of installing the gods and the day of <hi>v&#257;stun</hi> ceremony, are observed as festivals, at which Brahmans are feasted, and <hi>l&#257;psi</hi>, <hi>churmu</hi> and <hi>kans&#257;r</hi> are offered to the gods.<note id="n82.6" n="6">K.

</p><p>The new settlement may be named after the deity whose advice brought about the move or after the headman. It is sometimes named after the particular incident which drove the people to seek their new home.<ref type="noteref" target="n82.6">[#6]</ref>
</p><p>A failure of the harvest is in most cases due to the irregularity of the rains. It is therefore ascribed to the displeasure of Indra, the god of rain, and Varuna, the god of water. The mode of propitiating these gods has already been described.
</p><p>Sometimes a cessation of rains is attributed to the wrath of the village-gods, whereupon the festival of <hi>Uj&#257;&#7751;i</hi> is celebrated in order to appease them. One day, preferably a Sunday, all the inhabitants go outside the village, and rich viands are cooked to be offered to the village-gods. At the same time, the headman performs a <hi>homa</hi> sacrifice and the dainties are partaken of after the villagers have thrown cocoanuts into the sacrificial fire.

So the word <hi>chelan</hi> may have come to be used for any oblation to M&#257;t&#257; and the expression swallowing the chelans may mean partaking of the oblation or offering of the M&#257;t&#257;.</note> of Mungi M&#257;t&#257; (the Dumb Mother).

</p><p>In event of this process being of no avail in restraining the disease, the headman of the village in the company of his wife performs a <hi>homa</hi> sacrifice in the places dedicated to the M&#257;t&#257;s, and offers an <hi>&#257;huti</hi>&#8212;a sacrificial oblation&#8212;when all the villagers dedicate cocoanuts to the sacrificial fire.<note id="n84.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Kolki.</note>

</p><p>When such a disease as <hi>shili</hi> (small-pox), <hi>sakharado</hi>, or <hi>kharav&#257;</hi> prevails largely among cattle, a belief gains ground that the Dheds (who flay the dead cattle and sell their hides) have poisoned the drinking water of the cattle in order to increase their earnings.<note id="n84.5" n="5">The Schoolmaster of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>The god K&#257;l-bhairav was brought into existence by the fury of god Shiva, when he, being extremely angry with Brahm&#257;, cut off the fifth head of the latter.

</p><p>(I worship K&#257;l-bhairav, the giver of food and of salvation, of auspicious and comely appearance, who is kind to his devotees.)
</p><p>Ganpati or Ganesh, about whose origin the traditional legends prevail, is represented with four hands, in one of which he holds a <hi>kamandalu</hi> (a gourd), in the second a <hi>l&#257;du</hi> (or a sweet-ball), in the third a <hi>parashu</hi> (or an axe), and in the fourth a <hi>jap-m&#257;l</hi> (or a rosary). He is sometimes called Dundalo (lit., big-bellied) because of his having a protuberant belly. He puts on a yellow garment and rides a mouse. His brother is K&#257;rtik-sw&#257;m&#299; who rides a peacock. His favourite dish consists of <hi>l&#257;dus</hi> or sweet-balls of wheat-flour fried in ghi and sweetened with molasses. Siddhi and Buddhi are the two wives of Ganpati. Before their marriage their father Vishwarupa had made a promise that he would bestow the hands of both on whomsoever circumambulated the whole Earth within one day. Ganpati reasoned that a cow and a mother are equal in merit to the Earth and by passing round the former, he got the hands of both. Ganpati is said to be the fastest writer of all, so that the sage Vy&#257;sa secured his services as a scribe, at the instance of Brahm&#257;, in writing the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rat. When R&#257;van had conquered all the gods and made them serve in his household, Ganpati had to become a cowherd and to look after cows and goats.<note id="n85.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Barton Female Training College, Rajkot.</note>
</p><p>On <hi>Vaish&#257;kh sud choth</hi>, known as Ganpati <hi>choth</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the fourth day of the bright half of Vaish&#257;kh, Ganpati is ceremoniously worshipped with red lead, red flowers, milk, curds, honey, etc. The image of the god is besmeared with red lead and ghi, and the remnant of this ointment is applied to the doors and windows of the house.<note id="n85.3" n="3">The Schoolmaster of Kolki.</note> Sweet-balls of wheat-flour fried in ghi and sweetened with molasses are first dedicated to Ganpati and are afterwards partaken of as the god&#8217;s gift.<note id="n85.4" n="4">The Schoolmaster of <corr sic="Dhank">Dhhank</corr>.</note>
</p><p>The people of Mah&#257;r&#257;shtra observe Ganpati <hi>choth</hi> on the 4th day of the bright half of <hi>Bh&#257;drapad</hi>, when an earthen image of Ganpati is made and worshipped with twenty kinds of leaves.<note id="n85.5" n="5">The Schoolmaster of Dhhank.</note>

</p><p>The M&#257;trik&#257;s are sixteen in number, and are worshipped on such auspicious occasions as a <hi>yajna</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi>, a sacrifice), a wedding, or the ceremony known as <hi>v&#257;stu</hi>.<note id="n85.7" n="7">The Schoolmaster of Aman.</note> Their installation consists in painting the following marks with red lac on the back walls of a house.

<pb n="86"/></p><p>The M&#257;trik&#257;s or M&#257;t&#257;s are worshipped during the Navar&#257;tra holidays also.

At each house they receive oil for the lamp and a handful of corn. On the last day, <hi>i.e.</hi>, on the ninth day, all the bowls are placed on the special site dedicated to the M&#257;t&#257;s.

</p><p>The M&#257;trik&#257;s are also supposed to be the <hi>grahas</hi> or planets which influence the life of a child in the womb, and their worship is believed to bring about an easy delivery.<note id="n86.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>There is also a family goddess of the name of M&#257;trik&#257;. In worshipping her, seven round spots are painted on a wall with red lac, and ghi is poured over them in such a manner as to form five small <hi>rel&#257;s</hi> (streams). A mixture of molasses and ghi is then applied to these spots with a piece of <hi>&#257;d&#257;chh</hi> (red cotton yarn). By this process the devotee secures the motherly regard of the goddess.<note id="n86.3" n="3">The Schoolmaster of Sanka.</note>
</p><p>One of the deities which preside over child-birth is Randal M&#257;t&#257; or Rann&#257; Devi, who is said to be the wife of the Sun.<note id="n86.4" n="4">The Schoolmaster of Sanka<corr>.</corr></note> In order to secure an easy delivery, pregnant women take a vow that they will invite one or more <hi>lot&#257;s</hi> (bowls) of this M&#257;t&#257;.

</p><p>The tufts round the shell of a cocoanut are pulled out, the nut is besmeared with chalk, and marks representing two eyes and a nose are painted on it. (Or the nut is so placed that the two spots on its surface represent eyes, and the pointed tuft of fibres between them serves the purpose of a nose). A bowl is placed on a piece of cloth stretched on a wooden stool, and the cocoanut is placed over the bowl. It is then dressed in elegant female attire, and a ghi lamp is kept constantly burning near it. This completes the <hi>sth&#257;pan</hi> or installation of Randal M&#257;t&#257;. Women bow down before this representation of the M&#257;t&#257;, and sing melodious tunes in its presence. On the morning of the following day, the image is carried to the temple of the village M&#257;t&#257;, the cocoanut is deposited there, and the garments are brought home. The cocoanut is <corr sic="subsquently">subsequently</corr> taken by the Brahman attendant of the M&#257;t&#257;.
</p><p>On the day of the installation it is customary to invite five <hi>gor&#257;&#7751;is</hi><note id="n86.a" n="A">Also known as <hi>sur&#257;sa&#7751;is</hi>.</note> (married women whose husbands are living) to a feast of <hi>khir</hi> and cakes.

On the day on which the <hi>lot&#257;s</hi> are to be invited, the pregnant woman takes a bath early in the morning, and calls upon thirteen <hi>gor&#257;&#7751;is</hi>, whom she invites to dinner by marking their foreheads with red lac. A Br&#257;hman is called to set up the M&#257;t&#257;s, whose installation takes place in the same manner as that of Randal. The piece of cloth spread on the wooden stool is required to be green. When the <hi>gor&#257;&#7751;is</hi> sit down to the dinner, the pregnant woman washes their right toes with milk and swallows that milk as <hi>charan&#257;mrit</hi> (lit. the nectar of the feet). The <hi>gor&#257;&#7751;is</hi> are required to taste a morsel of some preparation of milk before they begin their meal. At night, a company of women dance in a circle round the M&#257;t&#257;s, singing songs. Next morning a <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> is called, who declares the will of the M&#257;t&#257;s.

</p><p>There is a popular tradition that in ancient times cholera was subjugated by king Vikrama, and was buried underground. Once upon a time the British excavated the place in the belief that treasure was concealed there, and thus cholera was released. After many soldiers had fallen victims, the disease deity was at last propitiated by an oblation, and was handed over to the Bhangis (or scavengers)<corr>.</corr><note id="n88.2" n="2">The Schoolmaster of Jodia.</note>
</p><p>This association of the Bhangis with cholera is present in most of the beliefs current about the disease. There is a story that once upon a time a number of students had put up in a house by which a Bhangi was in the habit of passing frequently. He daily used to hear the students reciting the sacred texts and this produced in his mind the desire to become a Sanskrit scholar. For this purpose, having concealed his low birth, he went to Benares and by diligent study, soon became a <hi>pandit</hi>. He even married a girl of high caste. But his imposture being at last discovered, he burnt himself to death, and his ashes gave rise to the disease known as cholera.<note id="n88.3" n="3">The Schoolmaster of Kotda-Sangani.</note>
</p><p>At the present day, if the epidemic breaks out, the Bhangis are often suspected in some way or other of having brought it about.

<pb n="89"/></p><p>Another method by which the Bhangis are supposed to bring about cholera is to sprinkle the blood of a black cow on the image of Hanum&#257;n. The god is deeply offended at the insult, and in consequence spreads cholera in the neighbourhood. For this reason, offerings are burnt before Hanum&#257;n in order to stop an epidemic of cholera.<note id="n89.1" n="1">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>Bhangis are also supposed by some to accomplish the same result by the help of <hi>malin</hi> or evil deities who are first gratified by the offering of victims.<note id="n89.2" n="2">The School Master of Chhatrasa.</note> One of such deities is R&#257;mdepir, to whom <hi>bali-d&#257;n</hi> (offering of a victim) is made by the people, through the medium of Bhangis, for the prevention of cholera.<ref type="noteref" target="n89.2">[#2]</ref>
</p><p>An outbreak of cholera offers a good opportunity to the Bhangis, who extort dainties and small sums of money from the people. Persons attacked by cholera often seek the services of a Bhangi and promise him liberal gifts if they are cured. The latter generally treats his patients by tying a magical thread round their elbows.<note id="n89.3" n="3">The School Master of Jodia.</note>
</p><p>It is said that the Bhangis have to present an offering to their <hi>malin</hi> or evil goddess every third year, and that, in so doing, they kill a black animal before the goddess. They then place an iron pan full of sesamum oil on the fire, and suspend the body of the animal above it. It is believed that as many human beings will fall victims to cholera as the number of the drops of blood that fall from the body of the animal into the iron pan.<note id="n89.4" n="4">The School Master of Mendarda.</note>
</p><p>Another deity whose wrath is supposed to be responsible for the breaking out of cholera is Mah&#257;m&#257;ri Devi.<note id="n89.5" n="5">The School Master of Movaiya.</note> The worshippers of this goddess are Bhangis. She is believed to send forth cholera when her oblations are stopped,<note id="n89.6" n="6">The School Master of Vanod.</note> and her favour is regained by renewing the offer of these oblations. Sometimes the <hi>Navachandi</hi> sacrifice is performed at the principal village-gates, and the <hi>chandip&#257;th</hi> is recited at the other gates. A number of Br&#257;hmans and virgins are also feasted, and presented with garments. A magic cotton thread is passed round the village and a <hi>dh&#257;r&#257;-v&#257;di</hi>, or stream of milk, is poured out. The <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> go round the village playing upon the harsh unpleasant <hi>danklan</hi>. A goat is then taken to the temple of the M&#257;t&#257;, and the <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi>, after cutting out its tongue, dip their hands in its blood and strike them against the doors of the temple. The goat is then killed and <corr sic="Similar">similar</corr> blood-marks are made upon every door in the village as well as on the village-gates, where an iron nail is driven into the ground with an incantation. A lime is then cut, and an oblation is offered to the M&#257;t&#257;. Such a process is believed to stop the progress of the epidemic.<ref type="noteref" target="n89.6">[#6]</ref>
</p><p>Other deities connected in popular belief with cholera are the goddesses Visuchik&#257;<note id="n89.7" n="7">The School Masters of Devalia and Vasavad.</note> and Chandik&#257;.<note id="n89.8" n="8">The Shastri of Jetpur Pathshala.</note> Visuchik&#257; is conciliated by burnt offerings: the recitation of the <hi>chandip&#257;th</hi> wins the favour of Chandik&#257;. There is also a giantess named Karkat&#257; who is supposed to be responsible for cholera. She is said to have sprung from the sweat on the forehead of Brahm&#257; and to reside in the <hi>chandra mandal</hi> (or lunar sphere).<note id="n89.9" n="9">The School Master of Charadwa.</note>
</p><p>One of the remedies adopted to stop an epidemic of cholera is to propitiate Shiva by the performance of <hi>Rudray&#257;g</hi>,<note id="n89.a" n="A">These are different sacrifices, the first two in honour of Shiva, the third in honour of the goddess Chandi.</note> <hi>Mah&#257;rudra</hi>,<ref type="noteref" target="n89.a">[#A]</ref> <hi>Shatachandi</hi>,<ref type="noteref" target="n89.a">[#A]</ref> <hi>Homahavan</hi> and by bestowing gifts on Br&#257;hmans and other holy <pb n="90"/>men.<note id="n90.1" n="1">The School Master of Ganod.</note> Sometimes vows are observed with the same object in honour of a minor local deity named Lala Hardev.<note id="n90.2" n="2">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note> Another method of driving off the disease is to convey it to the body of a goat or a ram, or a he-buffalo, and to drive the animal out of the village.<note id="n90.3" n="3">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>Small-pox is believed to be the act of the goddess Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257;, who spreads the disease whenever she is desirous of having victims.<note id="n90.4" n="4">The School Master of Jodia.</note> Thus, in cases of small-pox, the patient very often receives no medical treatment, the only remedies adopted being directed towards the propitiation of the M&#257;t&#257;.<note id="n90.a" n="A">The patient is often entirely made over to the M&#257;t&#257; and is again purchased from her at a nominal price of a rupee and a quarter.&#8212;Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note> A number of vows are taken in the M&#257;t&#257;&#8217;s name, to be fulfilled after the patient has recovered. Many people accomplish their vows before the Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257; at Kalavad in J&#257;mnagar. A vow to visit this place after the patient&#8217;s recovery, and to abstain from certain things till the day of the visit, is taken by the mother of the affected person in case of a severe attack. But almost every village contains a temple of Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257;, and those, who cannot go to Kalavad, vow in the name of the local M&#257;t&#257;.<ref type="noteref" target="n90.4">[#4]</ref> One of such vows is to go to the temple of the M&#257;t&#257; with a burning hearth on the head.<ref type="noteref" target="n90.4">[#4]</ref> Such a vow is generally undertaken by the patient&#8217;s mother.
</p><p>Ordinarily in a case of small-pox, the patient is not allowed to bathe till he is completely free from all traces of the disease. A bath is then given on a Sunday, a Tuesday, or a Thursday, with water which has been heated by being placed in the sun. An image of Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257; is set up in the house near the water room, and the patient worships the image after the bath. The image is drawn in cowdung with two cotton seeds to represent the eyes. An offering of <hi>kulera</hi><note id="n90.b" n="B">A mixture of the flour of <hi>bajri</hi>, ghi, and molasses.</note> and curds is made to the goddess. Five virgins are invited to dinner, and are served with cold food. All the members of the household also partake of cold food. On the 7th or the 13th day of the bright half of a month the patient is taken to the temple of Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257;, when a cocoanut is broken in the presence of the goddess. Half of the cocoanut is brought home, the other half being carried away by the M&#257;t&#257;&#8217;s attendant. Some people place a new earthen vessel filled with water near the goddess. Silver eyes, which may be worth anything between half an anna and half a rupee, are dedicated to the M&#257;t&#257;.<ref type="noteref" target="n90.4">[#4]</ref>
</p><p>The first visit to the M&#257;t&#257; should take place on a Sunday or a Tuesday. The things vowed to the goddess are dedicated on this occasion. It is also necessary to go to the goddess again on the next Tuesday or Thursday after the first visit. This time only water and red lac are offered.<note id="n90.5" n="5">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note>
</p><p>During the course of the disease no low-caste person and no woman in her monthly course is allowed to cast his or her shadow on the patient.<ref type="noteref" target="n90.4">[#4]</ref> The women in the house are prohibited from combing their hair, or churning curdled milk, or indulging in sexual intercourse. Such acts are believed to cause extreme displeasure to the M&#257;t&#257;, who then causes some limb of the patient to be affected. Branches of <hi>nimb</hi> leaves are suspended over the doors of the house, and also round the patient&#8217;s bed. The same leaves are used to fan the patient.<ref type="noteref" target="n90.4">[#4]</ref>
<pb n="91"/></p><p>When a child suffers from the disease, it is often weighed against dates, which are first dedicated to the goddess, and then distributed amongst the poor.<note id="n91.1" n="1">The School Master of Jodia.</note> The child is taken to bow down before the goddess after nine or ten days from the date of attack, and the mother of the child offers several things to the M&#257;t&#257;, among which are grapes, sugar, a pinch of flour, a small earthen bowl full of water, and a blank sheet of paper.<note id="n91.2" n="2">The School Master of Sayala.</note>
</p><p>Different things are dedicated to the goddess according as the disease affects one part of the body or another. For instance, flour of <hi>b&#257;jr&#257;</hi> or <hi>juv&#257;ri</hi> is offered in case of bronchitis; silver models of the human eye when the disease affects the eyes; a <hi>goras</hi> (a black earthen vessel full of curds) in case of morbid heat; a piece of black paper, in high fever, and salt if there is an itching sensation.<note id="n91.3" n="3">The Deputy Educational Inspector of H&#257;l&#257;r.</note> The M&#257;t&#257; is said to live on cold food and to be very fond of things which have a cooling effect such as fruits, sugar, etc. The same things are given to the patient as food.<note id="n91.4" n="4">The School Master of Zinzuv&#257;da.</note>
</p><p>To secure the protection of Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257; for their children, women annually observe the vow of <hi>shili s&#257;tem</hi> on the 7th day of the dark half of <hi>Shr&#257;van</hi>. On this day the M&#257;t&#257; is said to visit every house and to roll herself on the hearth. No fire is, therefore, lighted in the hearth on this day: for if the M&#257;t&#257; comes and is scorched by the fire she is sure to bring misfortune on that household. For this reason, a number of dainties and all the food necessary for the day is prepared on the previous day. On the day of <hi>shili s&#257;tem</hi>, <hi>juv&#257;ri</hi> seeds are spread on the hearth, and after being sprinkled with red lac, a cowdung bowl containing a plant called <hi>va&#7751;a</hi> is placed upon them. The women of the house bathe with cold water and take only one meal during the day. They further abstain from sewing and embroidering during that day. Sometimes a Br&#257;hman is engaged to recite the <hi>Shital&#257; shloka</hi> from a book called Rudray&#257;mal.<note id="n91.5" n="5">The School Masters of Dh&#257;nk and Ganod.</note>
</p><p>The following legend is related of <hi>shili s&#257;tem</hi>. A certain woman once forgot to extinguish the fire in her hearth on <hi>R&#257;ndhan Chhetha</hi> (lit. cooking sixth), <hi>i.e.</hi>, the day previous to <hi>shili s&#257;tem</hi>. On the next day, the M&#257;t&#257; was scorched in the stomach when she came to roll herself on the hearth. In extreme anger the goddess cursed the woman saying that her only son would be burnt to death; and immediately the boy died. In her anguish the unfortunate mother confessed her fault to a friend, who advised her to go to the jungle and entreat the M&#257;t&#257; to give back her son. She found the goddess rolling in distress under a <hi>b&#257;bul</hi> tree. The woman slowly approached her, and began to comb out the M&#257;t&#257;&#8217;s hair. She then placed her son in the M&#257;t&#257;&#8217;s lap and entreated the goddess to revive the boy. The M&#257;t&#257; felt much relieved by the woman&#8217;s attentions and blessed her saying that her bosom should be as quiet as her own head. Immediately, at these words, the boy revived, to the intense joy of his mother.<note id="n91.6" n="6">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>Women whose relatives have recovered from a dangerous attack of small-pox observe a vow on every <hi>s&#257;tem</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the 7th day of the dark half of every month. They first bathe with cold water and, after offering an oblation of <hi>kuler&#257;</hi>, take their meals only once during the day. This food has to be prepared on the previous day.
</p><p>Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257; is described as riding an ass in a nude state with the half of a <hi>supadun</hi> (a winnowing fan) for an umbrella and with a swing in one hand, and a broom in the other.<note id="n91.7" n="7">The School Master of Ganod.</note> But more usually the M&#257;t&#257; is represented by a mere trunkless head in <pb n="92"/>stone, besmeared with red lead. This is said to be the head of Babhriv&#257;han, the son of Bh&#299;ma<note id="n92.a" n="A">Babhriv&#257;han was not the son of <corr sic="Bhima">Bh&#299;ma</corr>, he was the son of Arjun by Chitrangad&#257;, a princess of Manipur.</note> the second of the P&#257;ndavas by a N&#257;g mother. At the time of the Great War, he was sent by his mother from his residence in the <hi>p&#257;t&#257;l</hi> (the regions below this world) to assist his father, and as he did not know the P&#257;ndavas, he was asked to join the weaker side. On coming to the earth he first met with Krishna who took a promise from him to lop his own head off. In return, Krishna promised him that he would be immortal, invisible and worshipped by all, and the head was set up on the flag of the P&#257;ndavas. This head began to trouble the P&#257;ndavas after their victory, and could only be quieted by the promise of Krishna to have him recognised as a deity with unlimited powers. This head afterwards came to be known as the controller of small-pox. How the head of the male Babhriv&#257;han came to be identified with Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257;, it is difficult to explain.<note id="n92.1" n="1">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note>
</p><p>There is a tradition that a Kunbi once recovered his eyesight, lost in an attack of small-pox, by worshipping Shital&#257; M&#257;t&#257;, and by vowing not to tie his lock of hair till his blindness was cured.<note id="n92.2" n="2">The School Master of Jodia.</note>
</p><p>It is said that the powderlike substance which falls from the scabs of small-pox cures cataract if applied to the eyes.<ref type="noteref" target="n92.2">[#2]</ref>
</p><p>Daksha Praj&#257;pati once celebrated a great sacrifice, but did not invite his son-in-law Shiva. The latter was extremely enraged at the insult, and eight sorts of fever were in consequence produced by his breath at that time.<note id="n92.3" n="3">The School Master of Sanka.</note> According to another story <hi>z&#257;r</hi> or fever was created by Shiva in order to assist the demon B&#257;n&#257;sur in his contest with god Krishna, and it can be cured by the recitation of a piece called Ush&#257;haran, from the <hi>Harivansha</hi>.<note id="n92.4" n="4">The Mistress of Rajkot<corr sic=","/> Civil Station Girls&#8217; School.</note> Some persons attribute fever to the wrath of Vishnu, and declare that it can be avoided by the recitation of <hi>Vishnusahasran&#257;ma</hi>.<note id="n92.5" n="5">The School Master of Ganod.</note> Others believe it to be due to the anger of Shiva, and say that it can be cured by pouring a stream of water over the image of Shiva by offering <hi>bel</hi> leaves (<hi>Aegle marmelos</hi>) to him, and by reciting the <hi>Mrityunjaya mantra</hi> in his honour.<note id="n92.6" n="6">The Shastri of Jetpur Pathsh&#257;la.</note> Others again ascribe it to the displeasure of the gods Hari<note id="n92.b" n="B">Names of Vishnu and Shiva respectively.</note> and Har,<ref type="noteref" target="n92.b">[#B]</ref> saying that the heat is caused by the wrath of Shiva.<note id="n92.7" n="7">The School Master of Charadwa.</note>
</p><p>The following are some of the remedies adopted in cases of fever:

</p><p><figure id="p078" rend="image(images/p078.png)"><figDesc>The <hi>jantra</hi> of Mrityunjaya.</figDesc></figure> 

<pb n="93"/></p><p>(v) Tying a magic thread round the arm.<note id="n93.1" n="1">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note> On a Sunday or a Tuesday a woollen thread or a piece of five-coloured silken thread is taken to a <hi>b&#257;v&#257;</hi> or a <hi>jogi</hi>, who mutters a few mystic words, and makes seven knots in the thread. The thread is treated with frankincense, and then tied round the arm.<note id="n93.2" n="2">The School Master of Zinzuv&#257;da.</note>

</p><p>Periodical fevers are believed to be under the control of certain spirits. There is a story connected with almost every sort of fever, and it is believed that a person who listens to such a story is cured of fever.<note id="n93.3" n="3">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note> The following legend is connected with <hi>ek&#257;nterio</hi>&#8212;intermittent fever occurring on alternate days. Once a Bania, on his way to a village, came across a banyan tree where he unyoked his bullocks and went to a distance to seek for water. Ek&#257;nterio (the spirit controlling intermittent fever) resided on this tree, and when the Bania had gone sufficiently far he stole from behind the tree and carried away the Bania&#8217;s carriage together with his family. The Bania was much surprised to miss them on his return, but he soon found out the author of the trick, and pursued Ek&#257;nterio. That spirit however would not listen to the Bania&#8217;s entreaties to return his carriage, and the matter was at last referred for arbitration to Bochki Bai. The latter decided in favour of the Bania, and confined Ek&#257;nterio in a bamboo tube. He was released on the condition that he would never attack those persons who listen to this story.<note id="n93.4" n="4">The School Master of Jodia.</note>
</p><p>There is a flower garden to the west of Jodia where there is a tree called <hi>ghelun</hi> (mad) tree. Vows in honour of this tree are believed to be efficacious in curing fever.<ref type="noteref" target="n93.4">[#4]</ref>
</p><p>It has been already said above that such epidemic diseases as cholera or the plague are often supposed to be the result of the sinister practices of the Bhangis. There is a belief that the Bhangis sometimes prepare an image out of the flour of <hi>adad</hi> (phaseolus radiatus) and pierce it with needles, and it is said that for every hole made in the image one human being falls a victim to some epidemic disease. Such an image is sometimes placed in an earthen vessel and buried underground in a public way so that every <corr sic="passer by">passer-by</corr> treading on the spot where it is buried may be attacked by some disease. Or it is thrown into the well which is most used by village people, with the object that all persons drinking water from the well may perish by the disease.<note id="n93.5" n="5">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note>
</p><p>The Bhangis are also accused of causing an epidemic by means of boiling the ear of a buffalo and the flesh of an ox together in one vessel, it being believed that the virulence of the disease varies in proportion to the extent to which the boiling proceeds. This process is supposed to cause a disease among cattle also.<note id="n93.6" n="6">The Deputy Educational Inspector of Gohelwad.</note>
</p><p>Another belief is that the Bhangis charm seeds of <hi>adad</hi> and cloves by repeating magic incantations over them, and afterwards strew them on a highway in order that those who step on them may be attacked by cholera or some similar disease.<note id="n93.7" n="7">The School Master of Rajpara.</note> One motive suggested for such action is that they are thereby likely to receive their garments, which would be used for covering the bodies.<note id="n93.8" n="8">The School Master of Jasdan.</note> Also at the outbreak of such an epidemic, clothes, cocoanuts, ghi, molasses, wheat flour, etc., are offered by the people to the Bhangis, who in return give a <hi>dor&#257;</hi>, a piece of thread, of black wool to be worn by the afflicted persons.<note id="n93.9" n="9">The School Master of Rajpara.</note>
</p><p>But apart from such beliefs, the appearance of an epidemic is also attributed to other causes. There is the usual belief that it is caused by the diminution of virtue and the increase of sin among people and the <pb n="94"/>consequent wrath of the gods, who are only propitiated by the people again reverting to righteous ways and by the performance of sacrifices in their honour.<note id="n94.1" n="1">The School Master of Kotda-Sangani.</note>
</p><p>There is also a belief that the sixty-four Joganis, when they are desirous of victims, cause baneful epidemics among mankind, the remedies in such a case being such as offering a goat or a he-buffalo to them, or the observation of an <hi>uj&#257;ni</hi> in their honour.
</p><p>The following tale is related regarding an occurrence said to have taken place not long ago in the village of Verad. The headman of the village who was a Rajput by birth but who had lost his caste owing to irregular conduct with a woman, died of fever, and as he was an outcaste his body was buried instead of being cremated. Soon after, a number of persons in the same village happened to die of the same fever and the people conjectured that the late <hi>patel&#8217;s</hi> corpse must be lying in its grave with its face downwards chewing the <hi>khahan</hi> (? perhaps <hi>kaphan</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi> the cloth in which a corpse is wrapped). Many thought that the health of the village would not be restored until the corpse was replaced in the correct position with its face upwards and unless the <hi><corr sic="khapan">kaphan</corr></hi> was taken out of its mouth. But none ventured to do so, being dissuaded by the fear of meeting with a worse fate.
</p><p>But although they did not open the grave yet they arranged for certain vows to be taken in honour of the dead man, and that put a stop to the disease.<note id="n94.2" n="2">The School Master of Devalia.</note>
</p><p>Another story from the same place is that when small-pox once raged furiously in that village, the people of the place celebrated a magnificent feast of dainties prepared of wheat-flour, ghi, molasses, rice and pulse, and afterwards the Dheds of the village lopped off the head of a dead he-buffalo, burying it at the spot where the feast was held.<note id="n94.3" n="3">The School Master of Devalia.</note>
</p><p>The remedies adopted for the abatement of epidemic diseases have already been mentioned above, the most common being the winding of a cotton-thread, the pouring out of <hi>dh&#257;r&#257;v&#257;di</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, milk, in the village, and the taking of the <hi>rath</hi> of the M&#257;t&#257; in a procession beyond the village boundary, the epidemic being supposed to be expelled in the <hi>rath</hi>. In the last case, after the <hi>rath</hi> has been taken to the neighbouring village, a charmed peg is sometimes driven into the ground near the village boundary to prevent the epidemic from crossing back again.<note id="n94.4" n="4">The School Master of Sanka.</note>
</p><p>Mention has already been made of the deities which protect the cattle and to whose displeasure diseases among cattle are attributed. It is said that such diseases are very common during the <hi>vishi</hi> of Shiva. A cycle of twenty years is called a <hi>vishi</hi>, three such cycles making a complete <hi>samvatsar</hi> of sixty years. Each of such <hi>vishis</hi> is presided over and named after each of the three gods of the Trinity, Brahm&#257;, Vishnu and Shiva. The <hi>vishi</hi> of Brahm&#257; is characterized by protection and creation, that of Vishnu by growth and that of Shiva by destruction, the last often bringing on such calamities as plague, famine and diseases among cattle.<note id="n94.5" n="5">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>The following are some of the remedies practised by the village people in the case of certain cattle-diseases.
</p><p>In the case of such diseases as <hi>mov&#257; kharav&#257;</hi> or the like, there is a practice of burying a plough near one&#8217;s gates, which is afterwards covered with dust gathered from three streets and is worshiped with a branch of a tree, a plate of iron and red lead. This ceremony has to be performed either on a Sunday or a Tuesday, and the man who performs it has to remain naked at the time.<note id="n94.6" n="6">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>For the cure of <hi>valo</hi> (a disease in which the throat is inflamed), pieces of the stalk of <hi>kukad-vel</hi> (a kind of creeper) are tied <pb n="95"/>round the neck or the horns of the diseased animal and no other food except ghi and molasses is allowed to it for two or three days. A handful of salt is sometimes thrown on the back of the animal.<note id="n95.1" n="1">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk and the Shastri of Jetpur Pathshala.</note> Sesamum oil is also said to work as a good medicine in the case of the same disease.<note id="n95.2" n="2">The Shastri of Bhayavadur Pathashala.</note>
</p><p>Another remedy for the same disease is to pass a knotted bamboo stick with seven knots seven times over the back of the ailing animal.<note id="n95.3" n="3">The School Master of Zinzuw&#257;da.</note>
</p><p>Ghi is sometimes used as a medicine in the case of small-pox. In the case of <hi>shakario</hi> or <hi>k&#257;lo v&#257;</hi>, the animal is branded in the affected limbs. To one suffering from a stye in the eye an ointment prepared from the horn of a deer is applied, while a mixture of whey and salt is said to be useful in most eye maladies. The treatment for the swelling of the belly is a mixture of molasses, <hi>ajamo</hi> (ligusticum ajwaen) and <hi>sanchal</hi> (a kind of salt). To cure an animal of <hi>kh&#257;pari</hi> (a disease which affects milch-cattle), the milk of the affected animal is poured on <hi>r&#257;fd&#257;</hi> (a kind of jujube tree). If after delivery, some part of the embryo remains inside an animal, milk and molasses are given to expedite its removal.<note id="n95.4" n="4">The Shastris of Jetpur and Bhayavadur.</note>
</p><p>In the case of <hi>kharav&#257;</hi> the ailing animal is made to move about in hot sand and is treated with salt, which is first fried on the fire of <hi>Holi</hi>. The remedy for the disease known as <hi>kumbhava</hi> is to give a dose of castor oil, <hi>sanchal</hi>, <hi>ajamo</hi> and hot water to the sick animal and also to tie a magic thread round its neck.<note id="n95.5" n="5">The School Master of Wala Taluka.</note>
</p><p>A disease called <hi>okarinu</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi>, vomitting) sometimes breaks out among sheep. In this case the shepherds separate all the affected animals from the herd and remove them to a distance. All the sheep which die of the disease are buried deep in a pit, which is guarded for several days, lest some other animals dig it up and let lose the buried epidemic by exposing the carcasses. It is believed that the contagion of this disease lies in the ears; and the ears of all the sheep in the herd are carefully watched if they bleed.<note id="n95.6" n="6">The School Master of Anandpur.</note>
</p><p>The twin gods <corr sic="Ashivini">Ashvini</corr> Kum&#257;r are sometimes propitiated by means of an <hi>anushth&#257;n</hi> (the performance of religious austerities in their honour) in order that they may put a stop to a disease among cattle.<note id="n95.7" n="7">The School Master of Kotda-Sangani.</note>
</p><p>It appears that dancing often forms a part of the process of exorcism. Frequently dancing is accompanied by the beating of cymbals and drums and other loud noises. A <hi>mandalu</hi> is convened at the house of the person who is to be exorcised <hi>i.e.</hi>, a number of <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> are invited to attend along with a number of low-caste drummers, and afterwards the ceremony of <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> is gone through; the <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> is then taken to a cemetery.<note id="n95.8" n="8">The School Master of Zinzuw&#257;da.</note>
</p><p>Sometimes the beating of drums and cymbals is alone resorted to for expelling an evil spirit from the person of a patient. It is believed that this process is effectual in proportion to the degree of the intensity of the noise created.<note id="n95.9" n="9">The School Master of Kotda-Sangani.</note> The patient is asked to sit facing the east. The B&#257;val or V&#257;ghri <hi>i.e.</hi>, the drummer, sits in front of him, and not only beats the drum as loudly as he can, but also sings hymns at the top of his voice in honour of his favourite goddess. In the meanwhile, the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi>, who is also in attendance, begins to be possessed, and discloses the fact by convulsive fits. After a while, the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> suddenly stamps his foot furiously on the floor, and, seizing the patient by a lock of his hair, and perhaps even giving him a blow on the back, asks in a stern voice<corr>,</corr> &#8220;Who art thou? speak out at once why thou hast come or else I will burn thee to death.&#8221;<note id="n95.a" n="A">All this of course is addressed to the evil spirit which is supposed to have possessed the patient.</note>
<pb n="96"/></p><p>The patient will then perhaps reply: &#8216;Don&#8217;t you know me? I am <hi>ch&#257;ran</hi>&#8217;, or I am <hi>z&#257;mh&#257;di</hi>, (a female spirit guarding the village gates) or <hi>V&#257;gharan</hi><note id="n96.a" n="A">Feminine of V&#257;ghri belonging to the V&#257;ghri caste.</note> or <hi>Purvaj</hi> (the spirit of a deceased ancestor). Regarding the reason for possession, the evil spirit will give some such explanation as follows:&#8212;&#8220;Once upon a time the patient was taking a loaf and vegetables which he hid from me, and therefore I shall leave his person only with his life.&#8221; The <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> will then say &#8220;life is precious and not so cheap as you think. If you want anything else, say so and leave this person.&#8221; After a dialogue such as the above, the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> and the spirit come to some compromise, and the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> then leads a procession with the <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> either to the village boundary or to a cemetery. The <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> then draws a circle on the ground with the point of a sword which he carries, and places the <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> within the circle. He then slightly cuts the tip of his tongue with the edge of the sword, and spits blood into a fire lighted for the purpose. The smoke of this fire is supposed to carry the offering to the evil spirit. The <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> is then taken away by the drummers, who share it secretly with the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi>. In the event of the patient deriving no benefit from this ceremony, the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> advises the patient&#8217;s relatives to repeat the process.<note id="n96.1" n="1">The School Master of S&#257;nk&#257;.</note>
</p><p>The following ceremony is sometimes performed in order to ascertain whether a person is under the influence of an evil spirit or not. A <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> is invited to the patient&#8217;s house in the company of drummers, and there he dances for some time amidst the din produced by the beating of the drums and by the loud recitation of hymns in honour of his favourite goddess. Afterwards a handful of grain is passed round the head of the patient and presented to the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> for inspection. The <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> selects a few seeds from the grain and making certain gestures, offers them to the patient with either the words &#8216;<hi>v&#257;cho</hi>&#8217; or &#8216;<hi>vadh&#257;vo</hi>&#8217;. In case the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> says &#8216;<hi>v&#257;cho</hi>&#8217; and the number of seeds happens to be even, what he declared to be the cause of the patient&#8217;s trouble is believed to be true. So also if the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> says <hi>vadh&#257;vo</hi> and the number of seeds proves to be odd. But in case the number of seeds proves to be odd when the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> says &#8216;<hi>v&#257;cho</hi>&#8217;, or even, when he says <hi>vadh&#257;vo</hi>, then his explanation of the cause of the patient&#8217;s trouble is not credited.
</p><p>Sometimes Br&#257;hmans instead of <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> are engaged to exorcise an evil spirit from the body of a sick person. A <corr sic="bellmetal">bell-metal</corr> dish, containing <hi>adad</hi> (phaseolus radiatus)<corr>,</corr> wheat and <hi>jow&#257;ri</hi>, is placed on a copper jar and struck violently with a stick, called <hi>velan</hi>, so as to produce a loud noise. The patient, who is made to sit in front, begins to tremble and sometimes even to rave. The Br&#257;hmans also create a loud noise and in a loud voice ask the patient who the evil spirit is and what it wants. The patient will then give out the name of some notorious <hi>d&#257;kan</hi> (witch) or of one of his deceased ancestors and will add that he desires a certain thing which he was used to get while in human form. The evil spirit is then propitiated by offering the things asked for and is requested to leave the body of the patient.<note id="n96.2" n="2">The School Masters of Ganod, Vanod and Kolki.</note>
</p><p>The following are other methods of expelling an evil spirit from the body:&#8212;
</p><p>Either <hi>lobh&#257;n</hi><corr>,</corr> <hi>i.e.</hi>, incense powder, or chillies or even the excreta of dogs are burnt under the nose of the patient, who, overpowered<corr sic=","/> by the unpleasant odour, is supposed to give out the name of the evil spirit and also what the latter wants.
</p><p>Water is charmed with incantations, and is either dashed against the patient&#8217;s eyes or is given to him to drink.<note id="n96.3" n="3">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>If the evil spirit possessing a patient is a <hi>purvaj</hi><corr>,</corr> <hi>i.e.</hi>, the spirit of a deceased ancestor, <pb n="97"/>either <hi>N&#257;r&#257;yan-bali Shr&#257;ddha</hi> or <hi>Nil-Parvani Shr&#257;ddha</hi> or <hi>Tripindi Shr&#257;ddha</hi> is performed in order to propitiate it, and a party of Br&#257;hmans is invited to dinner. In case the <hi>purvaj</hi> is a female, a cocoanut is installed in a <hi>gokhalo</hi> (a niche) in the wall to represent it, <hi>ghi</hi> lamps are lighted, and frankincense is burnt every morning before it. On the anniversary of the death of the <hi>purvaj</hi> a party of <hi>gor&#257;nis</hi> (unwidowed women) is invited to dinner.<note id="n97.1" n="1">The School Master of Limbdi Taluka.</note>
</p><p>If a woman is believed to be possessed by a <hi>d&#257;kan</hi>, she is made to hold a shoe in her teeth and is taken to the village boundary, where the shoe is dropped, and a circle is drawn round it with water from a bowl carried by the party. The holding of the shoe by the teeth signifies a vow on the part of the <hi>d&#257;kan</hi> never to re-enter the person of the exorcised woman.<note id="n97.2" n="2">Mr. B. K. Des&#257;i.</note>
</p><p>The following are other occasions for religious dancing, namely during the <hi>Nav-r&#257;tra</hi> holidays (<hi>i.e.</hi>, the festival which commences from the 1st day of the bright half of <hi><corr sic="&#193;shvin">&#256;shvin</corr></hi> and lasts for nine days); at the time of offering oblations to the village-gods; on the occasion of setting up a pillar in memory of a deceased person; at the time of the <hi>Nilotsava</hi><note id="n97.a" n="A"><hi>Nilotsava</hi> or <hi>Nil-parn&#257;vum</hi> is a ceremony performed in honour of a young man, who has come to an untimely end. The chief part of the ceremony is the performance of the wedding of a bull-calf with a heifer. Sometimes a member of the deceased youth&#8217;s family is possessed on such an occasion by the spirit of the deceased man and is believed to have then the power of correctly answering questions about future events, etc.&#8212;The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note> ceremony.
</p><p>At the time when Randal the wife of Surya is installed and worshipped, a party of young women dance in a circle before the goddess to the accompaniment of <hi>garabis</hi>.<note id="n97.3" n="3">The School Master of Devali&#257;.</note>
</p><p>The eighth day of the bright half of <hi>&#256;shvin</hi> is dedicated to the worship of the <hi>M&#257;t&#257;s</hi> and <hi>devis</hi> (minor goddesses), and on this day, <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> have to dance each before his favourite <hi>m&#257;t&#257;</hi>. This they have also to do on the 1st day of the bright half of <hi>&#256;sh&#257;dh</hi>. <hi>Bhuv&#257;s</hi> are also invited to dance on the <hi>Diw&#257;s&#257;</hi> day <hi>i.e.</hi>, the last day of <hi>&#256;sh&#257;dh</hi>.<ref type="noteref" target="n97.3">[#3]</ref>
</p><p>The <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> occupies a high place in the esteem of the village people, and commands much respect. In the first place, his position is that of a medium between the gods and goddesses on the one hand and human beings on the other.<note id="n97.4" n="4">The School Masters of Dh&#257;nk and Kotda Sangani.</note> He is the interpreter of the will of the gods, which he expresses to the public when in a state of trance. Besides he is believed to have power over the evil spirits which are visible to a <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> though cannot be seen by ordinary eyes.<note id="n97.5" n="5">The School Master of Sanka.</note> He is the guardian of the village, his duty, being to protect the people from the malignant influence of the evil spirits.<ref type="noteref" target="n97.5">[#5]</ref>
</p><p>In the next place, it is also the office of the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> to treat the sick. In cases when medicine is unavailing and where the malady is supposed to be the work of some evil spirit, the opinion of the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> is sought by the relations of the patient and is given by the test of the scrutiny of grain.<note id="n97.6" n="6">The School Master of Dadvi.</note> When the sick person is found to be under the influence of a spirit, the common mode of exorcising is to take an <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> to the cemetery. An image of a human being is prepared out of the flour of <hi>adad</hi> (phaseolus <corr sic="radialus">radiatus</corr>) and is passed round the body of the sick person. The <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> then holds the image near his heart and stretches himself on a bier with the image on his bosom. In this condition the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> is taken to the cemetery, and the evil spirit is believed to be driven by these means out of the patient&#8217;s body.<note id="n97.7" n="7">The School Masters of Dadvi and Kolki.</note>
</p><p>The <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> distributes <hi>dor&#257;s</hi> (magic threads) and anklets among the people. Such things are coveted for their efficacy in warding off the influence of evil spirits and are often sought after by people for their cattle as well as for <pb n="98"/>themselves.<note id="n98.1" n="1">The School Masters of Kotd&#257; <corr sic="Sangni">Sangani</corr> and Sanka.</note> The prosperity of the <hi>d&#257;nkl&#257;n-vag&#257;dn&#257;rs</hi> (those who beat the drum) depends to a large extent on the success of the <hi>bhuv&#257;&#8217;s</hi> business, and for this reason, the drummers are often very good advocates of the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> and take every opportunity of glorifying his powers and merits.
</p><p>The respect which a <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> commands in this way is sometimes increased by the performance of such tricks as his putting lighted torches into his mouth, placing his hand in boiling oil, and similar performances.
</p><p>But although there may be some <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> who profit by imposing upon the credulity of the villagers, there are many <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> who do not work with the expectation of any reward, and are only actuated by benevolent motives. Many of them honestly believe that at the time when they are thrown into a state of trance, the <hi>m&#257;t&#257;s</hi> or deities actually enter their bodies and speak their wishes through them as a medium.
</p><p>In some villages, the office of the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> is hereditary, and lands have been assigned to them in remuneration for their duty<note id="n98.2" n="2">The School Master of Zinzuw&#257;d&#257;.</note>. In addition to this religious calling, a <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> often follows some other profession as that of agriculture, weaving or spinning.<note id="n98.3" n="3">The School Master of Jodi&#257;.</note>
</p><p>The <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> generally belongs to some low caste and may be a Koli, Bharv&#257;d<corr>,</corr> Rab&#257;ri, V&#257;ghri or even a Cham&#257;r. The <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> are also known as <hi>pothi&#257;s</hi>. One good qualification for becoming a <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> is to possess the habit of throwing one&#8217;s self into convulsive fits followed by a state of trance, especially on hearing the beating of a <hi>d&#257;nkl&#257;n</hi> (drum). At such a time the <hi>m&#257;t&#257;</hi> or <hi>devi</hi> is supposed to possess the person of the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> and to speak out her wishes on being questioned. Some <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> are regularly possessed by some <hi>devi</hi> or <hi>m&#257;t&#257;</hi> on every Sunday or Tuesday.<note id="n98.4" n="4">The School Master of S&#257;nka.</note>
</p><p>A typical <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> has a braid of hair on his head, puts one or more iron or copper anklets round his leg or elbow, and makes a mark with red lead on his forehead. A <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> attending upon the goddess Meldi is generally<note id="n98.5" n="5">The School Master of Dadvi.</note> a V&#257;ghri by caste and always wears dirty clothes. A Bharv&#257;d <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> has generally a silver anklet round his waist. A <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> has to observe a fast on all the nine days of the <hi>Nav-r&#257;tras</hi>. If a <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> happens to come across another <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> in convulsive fits or in a trance, he must need go into fits as well.
</p><p>Generally speaking every <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> keeps an image of his favourite <hi>m&#257;t&#257;</hi> in or near his own dwelling. Generally he erects a hut for the purpose and hoists a flag upon it. Near the image are placed a number of conch-shells and stones and brooms of peacock feathers. The deity is not systematically worshipped every day but receives adoration every Sunday and Tuesday. Sometimes the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> has a disciple&#8212;a <hi>sevaka</hi>&#8212;who does the duty of dashing bell-metal cymbals at the time when the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> throws himself in a trance.<note id="n98.6" n="6">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note>
</p><p>When a new <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> is to be initiated into the profession, he is made to sit before an image of the <hi>m&#257;t&#257;</hi>, where he goes into convulsive fits while the <hi>d&#257;nkl&#257;n vag&#257;dn&#257;rs</hi> beat the drums and loudly recite hymns in honour of the deity. Afterwards he is taken to a cemetery accompanied by the drummers and an expert <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi>, where the latter marks out a square on the ground with the edge of a sword. The novice is asked to lie prostrate within the area thus marked out and to get up and lie again, doing the same four times, each time with his head towards each of the four quarters. The <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> who initiates the novice and who is thenceforth considered to be the <hi>guru</hi> or preceptor of the latter, ties a <hi>r&#257;khadi</hi> (a piece of silk thread) round the elbow of the pupil.<note id="n98.7" n="7">The Schoolmaster of P&#257;tanv&#257;v.</note>
<pb n="99"/></p><p>Every <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> is required to propitiate his favourite goddess every third year, the ceremony which is then performed being called <hi>Khad-Khadya-bes&#257;dvi</hi>. This is performed either during the <hi>Nav-r&#257;tra</hi> holidays or during the bright half of either the month of <hi>M&#257;gh</hi> or <hi>Chaitra</hi>. All the <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> in the village are invited on the occasion, when there is <hi>g&#257;nj&#257;</hi>-smoking or <hi>bh&#257;ng</hi>-drinking, partly at night. After the supper which follows this party, all the <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> gather together and go into convulsive fits till they are almost suffocated. Cocoanuts are then dedicated and cracked before the <hi>m&#257;t&#257;</hi>, and the kernel is distributed among those present. The party then break up.<note id="n99.1" n="1">The School Master of S&#257;nk&#257;.</note>
</p><p>It is believed by some people that the spirit of a Muhammadan saint, living or dead, dwells in such trees as the <hi>Khijado</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, <hi>Shami</hi> (Prosopis spicigera) and <hi>B&#257;val</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, <hi>B&#257;bhul</hi> (Acacia arabica). It is known by the name of <hi>chitharia</hi> that is, the ragged <hi>Pir</hi>. It is a common belief that if a mother fails to offer a rag or a piece of cloth to such a holy tree while passing by it, her children run the risk of falling ill. Women and ignorant people, therefore, make a point of offering rags to such trees whenever they happen to pass by them.<note id="n99.2" n="2">The School Master of Kotda Sangani.</note>
</p><p>According to another belief, travellers, in order to accomplish their journey safely, offer rags to such of the <hi>Khijado</hi>, <hi>B&#257;val</hi> or <hi>Limdo</hi> (Nim) trees as are reputed to be the residences of spirits, if they happen to be on their road.<note id="n99.3" n="3">The School Master of Davali&#257;.</note>
</p><p>Some believe that both male and female spirits reside in the <hi>Khijado</hi>, <hi>B&#257;val</hi> and <hi>Kerado</hi> trees, and throw rags over them with the object of preventing passers by from cutting or removing the trees. Some pile stones round their stems and draw tridents over them with red lead and oil. If superstitious people come across such trees, they throw pieces of stones on the piles, believing them to be holy places, and think that by doing so they attain the merit of building a temple or shrine. A belief runs that this pile should grow larger and larger day by day, and not be diminished. If the base of such a tree is not marked by a pile of stones, rags only are offered; and if rags are not available, the devotee tears off a piece of his garment, however costly it may be, and dedicates it to the tree.<note id="n99.4" n="4">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>Once, a child saw its mother offering a rag to such a tree, and asked her the reason of the offering. The mother replied that her brother, that is the child&#8217;s maternal uncle, dwelt in the tree. Hence a belief arose that a <hi>chithario</hi> (ragged) uncle dwells in such trees. Others assert that the <hi>chithario pir</hi> dwells in such trees, and they propitiate him by offering cocoanuts and burning frankincense before it.<ref type="noteref" target="n99.4">[#4]</ref>
</p><p>There is a <hi>Khijado</hi> tree near Sult&#257;npur which is believed to be the residence of a demon <hi>m&#257;mo</hi>. This demon is propitiated by the offerings of rags.
</p><p>Some declare that travellers fix rags of worn out clothes to the trees mentioned above in order that they may not be attacked by the evil spirits residing in them. Another belief is that the spirits of deceased ancestors residing in such trees get absolution through this form of devotion. It is also believed that a goddess called <hi>chitharia devi</hi> resides in such trees, and being pleased with these offerings, blesses childless females with children, and cures persons suffering from itch of their disease. There is a further belief that ragged travellers, by offering pieces of their clothes to the <hi>Khijado</hi>, <hi>B&#257;val</hi> or <hi>Kerado</hi> trees, are blessed in return with good clothes.
</p><p>Some believe that Hanum&#257;n, the lord of spirits, resides in certain trees. They call him <hi>chithario</hi> or ragged Hanum&#257;n. All passers by offer rags to the trees inhabited by <pb n="100"/>him. There is such a tree near the station of Shiroi. There is a tamarind tree on the road from Tamnagar to Khantalia which is believed to be the residence of <hi>chithario</hi> Hanum&#257;n and receives similar offerings. Another tamarind tree of this description is near Marad and there is a <hi>Khijado</hi> tree on the road between K&#257;l&#257;vad and V&#257;vadi which is similarly treated.<note id="n100.1" n="1">The School Master of Limbdi Taluka.</note>
</p><p>It is related by some people that in deserts trees are rare and the summer heat is oppressive. To the travellers passing through such deserts, the only place of rest is in the shadow of a solitary tree that is to be met occasionally. In order that no harm be done to such trees, some people have given currency to the belief that a spirit called <hi>m&#257;mo</hi> dwells in such trees and expects the offering of a rag and a pice at the hands of every passer by.<ref type="noteref" target="n100.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>Some are of opinion that the <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi>, in order to raise money from the credulous by terrifying them, daub a tree within the limits of each village with the form of a trident, and fix rags to it, stating that it is the abode of a <hi>m&#257;mo</hi> or a <hi>pir</hi>. At times they ask their clients to offer certain things to such trees, which they appropriate to themselves.<note id="n100.2" n="2">The School Master of Kolki.</note>
</p><p>There is also a belief, that the holy trees that receive offerings of rags from travellers, are the abodes of gods or evil spirits, and are distinguished from other trees of the same species by the epithet of <hi>chithario</hi>. Some people hoist flags on such trees instead of offering rags.
</p><p>In some places, the <hi>Bor&#257;di</hi> (jujube), <hi>Pipal</hi>, <hi>Vad</hi> (banyan) and the sweet basil receive offerings of a pice and a betelnut from travellers, while the <hi>Khijado</hi> and <hi>B&#257;val</hi> are given rags.<note id="n100.3" n="3">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>It is stated by some people that the belief in <hi>chithario</hi> pir has grown during the last four hundred years.
</p><p>Rags are never offered to wells, but it is common to offer them copper coins and betelnuts. Sometimes flags are hoisted near holy wells in honour of the water-goddess Jaldevki. Travellers hoist flags on certain wells and throw copper coins into them in the course of their journey. The origin of this offering is said to be in the desire of travellers to prevent people from committing a nuisance near wells.
</p><p>Some wells are noted as being the abode of spirits who have the power of effecting certain cures. It is customary to throw a pice in such wells. When a person is bitten by a rabid dog, he goes to a well inhabited by a <hi>v&#257;chharo</hi>, the spirit who cures hydrophobia, with two earthen cups filled with milk, with a pice in each, and empties the contents into the water.
</p><p>It is a belief among Hindus that to give alms in secret confers a great merit on the donor. Some of the orthodox people, therefore, throw pice into wells, considering it to be a kind of secret charity.
</p><p>The belief in the practices adopted for transferring disease from one person to another obtains mostly among women, who have recourse to such practices for curing their children.
</p><p>One of such practices is to lay a suffering child in the cradle of a healthy child. This act is believed to result in transferring the disease of the ailing child to the healthy child. Another practice is that the mother of the sickly child should touch the mother of a healthy child with the object of transferring the disease of her child to the child of the latter. Some believe that the mere contact of an ailing child with a healthy child is sufficient to transfer the malady of the former to the person of the latter. Others maintain that this can be brought about by a mother either by touching the cradle of another <pb n="101"/>child or by touching the person of another woman. There are others, who hold that the disease of a sickly child can be transferred to another child by feeding the latter with the leavings of the former. There is a further belief that a mother can transfer the disease of her suffering child to the child of another woman by applying the end of her robe to the end of the robe of the latter. In some places, when a child begins to weaken, its mother makes an idol of cow or buffalo dung, and keeps it fixed to a wall of the house, in the belief that the child will be cured slowly as the idol dries. It is stated that instances are actually known of the recovery of children by this process. These methods of transferring disease are called <hi>tuchak&#257;s</hi> <hi>i.e.</hi> mystic methods. As a rule superstitious women practise them on Sundays or Tuesdays, as it is believed, that to be efficacious, they must be practised on these days.
</p><p>In addition to the <hi>tuchak&#257;s</hi> above stated the <hi>ut&#257;rs</hi>, <hi>dor&#257;s</hi>, etc., already described, are used for curing diseases.
</p><p>Some diseases are attributed to <hi>vir</hi> possession. <hi>Virs</hi> are male spirits fifty two in number. The <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> or exorcists are believed to have control over them, and are supposed to be able to detect an illness caused by possession by a vir. In such cases, the <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> drive away the evil spirits from the patients by magic incantations, or transfer them to others by waving a certain number of grain seeds round the head of the patient. By another process the <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> can confine the evil spirit in a glass bottle, which is buried underground.
</p><p>In order to eradicate a dangerous disease, an <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> is frequently offered to a dog, in the belief that by eating the <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> the disease is transferred to the dog.
</p><p>In some places, diseases of long standing due to spirit possession are cured by employing a <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi>, (exorcist), who, accompanied by others of his order, goes to the patient&#8217;s house, makes a bamboo bier, waves an <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> round the patient&#8217;s head, and lays himself on the bier with the <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> by his side. The bier is carried to the burning ground by four persons to the accompaniment of the beatings of drums, followed by the exorcists, who throw <hi>b&#257;kl&#257;ns</hi> (round flat cakes of <hi>juv&#257;ri</hi> flour) into the air as the procession moves on. When the party reach the burning ground, the bier is put down, and the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi>, shaking violently, offers the <hi>ut&#257;r</hi> to a spirit of the place. He then prostrates himself four times with his face turned towards the four directions and drives a nail into the ground at each turn. Next, the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> lets loose a goat or a ram, to which the vir in the body of the patient is supposed to be transferred. It is said that the performance of this rite relieves the patient&#8217;s mind of anxiety regarding the cause of his disease, and he thereafter shows signs of improvement.<note id="n101.1" n="1">The School Master of Zinzuw&#257;d&#257;.</note>
</p><p>When a man is suffering from <hi>&#257;njani</hi> (a sore or mole on the eye-lid) he goes to another person&#8217;s house and strikes earthen vessels against his door saying &#8220;I have shaken the vessels. May the <hi>&#257;njani</hi> be with me to-day and with you tomorrow&#8221;. It is also stated that such a patient goes to the house of a man who has two wives while the latter <corr sic="is">are</corr> asleep, and taps his door uttering the words &#8220;<hi>Anjani ghar bh&#257;ngani &#257;j mane ane kal tane</hi>&#8221; <hi>i.e.</hi>, &#8220;May <hi>&#257;njani</hi>, the breaker of the house, be to-day with me and tomorrow with thee.&#8221; This process is believed to transfer the disease from the person of the patient to that of the husband of the two wives.
</p><p>A common method for transferring disease is to wave water round a sick person and give it to another to drink. Similarly, a goblet filled with water is passed round a patient&#8217;s head and offered to a <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi>, who drinks off the contents.
</p><p>A belief prevails all over Gujar&#257;t that a disease can be passed from one species of <pb n="102"/>animals to another, and various practices are adopted to effect this. Generally a <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> or exorcist arranges the transfer. The <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi>, accompanied by a troupe of dancers and drummers, visits the house of the sick person and, after examining corn seeds <hi>d&#257;n&#257;s</hi> which have been waved round the patient&#8217;s head on a night preceding a Sunday or Tuesday, declares that the evil spirit possessing the patient requires a living victim. A cock, goat or a male buffalo is then brought as a substitute for the patient, is waved round him, the tip of its right ear is cut off, and it is offered to the <hi>m&#257;t&#257;</hi> or goddess, that is, it is released to stray as it pleases. These goats, etc., are called <hi>m&#257;t&#257;&#8217;s</hi> goats, <hi>m&#257;t&#257;&#8217;s</hi> cocks, or <hi>m&#257;t&#257;&#8217;s</hi> male buffaloes, and are seen wandering about in many villages. Sometimes the goat, etc., is killed before the image of the <hi>m&#257;t&#257;</hi> and the <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> dipping the palms of his hands into its blood, presses them against the doors of every house in the village. In the case of an outbreak of epidemic, the victim is set at liberty beyond the limits of the village affected. It is believed by some people that the animal to which a disease is conveyed in the above manner, dies of its effects.<note id="n102.1" n="1">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>In some places the patient is supposed to be possessed by a goddess instead of by an evil spirit. A goat, cock or a male buffalo is offered to the goddess in the same way as to an evil spirit.
</p><p>In some villages, when there is an outbreak of a serious epidemic, it is customary to drive a buffalo beyond the village boundary, with the disease on his back. The back of the buffalo which is chosen for this purpose is marked with a trident in red lead and covered with a piece of black cloth, on which are laid a few grains of <hi>adad</hi> and an iron nail. Thus decorated, the buffalo is driven beyond the limits of the village. It is believed that an animal driven in this way carries the disease wherever it goes.
</p><p>Very often, the beast to which a disease is transferred is kept tied to a post all its life, with the belief that by so doing the disease remains enchained. Jain teachers confine a disease in a bottle and bury it underground. Sometimes, a disease is passed on to a crow, whose legs are tied to a pillar, thus making it a life-long prisoner.
</p><p>Once upon a time, when there was an outbreak of cholera in a certain village, a <hi>b&#257;v&#257;</hi> (recluse) happened to arrive on the scene. He caught two rams, made them move in a circle, and left them in the burning ground, where they died, the epidemic disappearing with their death. Hence a belief gained ground that an epidemic of cholera can be expelled by passing it on to two rams or goats.<note id="n102.2" n="2">The Pathash&#257;l&#257; Shastri, Talpur.</note>
</p><p>It is related that, at Gondal, a case of cholera was cured by a Bhangi (sweeper) by waving a cock round the patient&#8217;s head.<note id="n102.3" n="3">The School Mistress of Gondal.</note>
</p><p>A few years ago there lived in Kh&#257;khi Jalia, a village in the vicinity of Kolki, a <hi>Kh&#257;khi</hi> (recluse) named N&#257;rand&#257;s, who, when laid up with fever, passed on the disease to his blanket, and after a time drew it back to his own person.

</p><p><hi>Purvajas</hi> or ancestral spirits descend to the level of ghosts when they are strongly attached to worldly objects. Such spirits often possess the bodies of their descendants, though the necessary <hi>Shr&#257;ddhas</hi> are performed for their release. The 13th, 14th and 15th days of the bright half of the months of <hi>K&#257;rtik</hi> and <hi>Chaitra</hi> are the special days for propitiation of departed spirits by their relatives either at home or in holy places, while the whole of the dark half of the month of <hi><corr sic="Bh&#257;darw&#257;">Bh&#257;darv&#257;</corr></hi> is devoted to this purpose.<note id="n103.a" n="A">This period of 15 days is called <hi>Shar&#257;dian</hi>.</note> During this fortnight, <hi>shr&#257;ddha</hi> is performed in honour of the deceased on the day corresponding to the day of his death, when Br&#257;hmans are feasted. Thus, a person dying on the 5th day of <hi>K&#257;rtik</hi> has his <hi>shr&#257;ddha</hi> performed on the 5th day of the <hi>shar&#257;dian</hi>. On this occasion, water is poured at the root of the <hi>Pipal</hi>, <hi>tarpan</hi> or offerings of water are made, and <hi>pinds</hi> or balls of rice are offered to the deceased.
</p><p>Of all the days of the <hi>shar&#257;dian</hi> the 13th, 14th and 15th are considered to be of special importance.
</p><p>The death <corr sic="annivesary">anniversary</corr> of a <hi>pitriya</hi> is called <hi>samvatsari</hi>, <hi>valgo samachari</hi> or <hi>chhamachhari</hi>, when a <hi>shr&#257;ddha</hi> is performed and Br&#257;hmans are feasted.
</p><p>The <hi>pitriyas</hi> are also worshipped on auspicious occasions such as marriages, by the performance of a <hi>shr&#257;ddha</hi> called <hi>n&#257;ndi</hi>, when <hi>pinds</hi> (balls) of molasses are offered instead of rice. It is considered an act of merit to perform <hi>shr&#257;ddha</hi> in honour of the <hi>pitriyas</hi> on the banks of a river or tank at midday on the 8th day of the dark half of a month.
</p><p>From the 13th to the 15th day of the dark half of <hi>Shr&#257;van</hi>, after their morning ablutions, orthodox people pour water over the <hi>Pipal</hi>, the <hi>B&#257;bul</hi>, the <hi>Ber</hi> (Zizyphus jujube) and<corr sic=","/> <hi>durv&#257;</hi> grass, and on those places where cows are known to congregate, in the belief that by so doing the thirst of the spirits of the deceased is quenched. It is also believed that if feasts are given to the relatives of the deceased and to Br&#257;hmans the <hi>pitriyas</hi> are satisfied.
</p><p>According to some, the <hi>Shar&#257;dian</hi> lasts from the full-moon day of the month of <pb n="104"/><hi>Bh&#257;darv&#257;</hi> to the new-moon day of the same month, that is for a period of sixteen days.

</p><p>The spirits of those who die with strong attachment to the objects of this world are said to enter the state known as <hi>asur gati</hi> or the path of demons. In this condition the spirit of the deceased possesses the person of one of his relatives and torments the family in which he lived. The members of the family, when worried by his persecutions, engage the services of a <hi>bhuv&#257;</hi> or exorcist, who sets up a wooden image of the tormenting spirit in a niche in a wall of the house. A lamp fed with <hi>ghi</hi> is lighted daily before this image, and in times of trouble, a cocoanut is offered to it in the belief that the spirit can protect the offerers from injuries.

</p><p>Rajputs, Bharv&#257;ds, Ahirs and Kolis set up either a pile of stones or a single stone on the boundary of their village in honour of those among them who die on battle fields.

</p><p>Every sect of Hindus has a <hi>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</hi> or spiritual head, and it is considered meritorious to entertain and worship him on certain special occasions. The <hi>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</hi> or <hi>Guru</hi> is received with great <hi>&#233;clat</hi>. His followers form a procession and carry him in a palanquin or a carriage and pair accompanied with music. At the house of the person who invites him, the floor is covered with rich cloth, over which the <hi>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</hi> is led to a raised seat specially arranged for the purpose. He is then worshipped by the host with the same details as the image of a god. His feet are washed by <hi>panch&#257;mrita</hi> (five nectars), that is a mixture of ghi, milk, honey, sugar and water, which is sipped by the worshipper and distributed among the followers of the <hi>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</hi>. Very often the feet of the <hi>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja</hi> are washed in water, which is considered as purifying as the <hi>panch&#257;mrita</hi>.

The <hi>bhut</hi> is defined as a deity that troubles infants and the <hi>pish&#257;cha</hi> as a deity that lives on flesh. <hi>Bhuts</hi> and <hi>pish&#257;chas</hi> are the <hi>ganas</hi> or attendants of Shiva, one of the gods of the Hindu Trinity. They are supposed to be <hi>upadevas</hi> or demi-gods.
</p><p><hi>Preta</hi> is the spirit of a person that dies a sudden or unnatural death with many of his desires unfulfilled. His soul attains emancipation by the performance of a <hi>sapt&#257;h</hi>, that is a recitation of the <hi>Bh&#257;gvat</hi> on seven consecutive days. It is described in the <hi>Bh&#257;gvat</hi> that Dhundhumari, the brother of Gokarn, who had become a <hi>preta</hi>, was released from his <hi>preta</hi> existence by the performance of a <hi>sapt&#257;h</hi> which his brother caused to be made. The <hi>Garudpur&#257;n</hi> mentions that King Babruv&#257;han emancipated a <hi>preta</hi> by the performance of a <hi>shr&#257;ddha</hi>. The <hi>mukti</hi> or salvation of a <hi>preta</hi> is in itself its death. This would prove <hi>pretas</hi> to be mortal.<note id="n107.1" n="1">Sh&#257;stri Bh&#257;y&#257;vadar P&#257;thsh&#257;l&#257;.</note>
</p><p>The span of life of the <hi>bhuts</hi> and <hi>pretas</hi> is very long, but those whose descendants offer them the usual oblations gain their emancipation sooner. There is a <hi>kund</hi> or spring called Zil&#257;nand in the vicinity of Jhinjhuv&#257;d&#257;, on the banks of which is a temple of Zilakeshwar Mah&#257;dev. The performance of the <hi>pitri shr&#257;ddha</hi> by the side of this spring is believed to expedite the emancipation of the spirits of the deceased from ghostly life. Every year, on the <hi>Bh&#257;darv&#257; am&#257;v&#257;sya</hi>, that is, the new moon day of the month <hi>Bh&#257;darv&#257;</hi>, a great fair is held on this spot, when people from long distances visit the place to get their relatives exorcised by the <hi>bhuv&#257;s</hi> or exorcists.
</p><p>It is believed, that though <hi>bhuts</hi>, <hi>pretas</hi> and <hi>pish&#257;chas</hi> are immortal, they are scared away by the sound of a European band and of other musical instruments.<note id="n107.2" n="2">The School Master of Todi&#257;.</note> It is said that all drums and other weird instruments whether European or Indian, have the power of scaring away evil spirits.
</p><p>An evil spirit called B&#257;baro had entered the person of the uncle of M&#257;ldev the king of Jh&#257;l&#257;v&#257;d much to the king&#8217;s annoyance. M&#257;ldev offered a stubborn fight to B&#257;baro, who, unable to cope with M&#257;ldev, promised to extend his kingdom over those villages in which he would hang up bunting in one night. It is said that the present extent of the J&#257;hlw&#257;d territories was due to king M&#257;ldev&#8217;s enterprise in hanging up bunting over these territories as asked by B&#257;baro.<note id="n107.3" n="3">The School Master of Jodi&#257;.</note>
</p><p>Though at the time of a man&#8217;s death the faculties may hardly be sound, yet the <hi>v&#257;rsan&#257;</hi>&#8212;the impressions&#8212;left on his mind by his past actions are in themselves good or bad enough to impress him so as to make his departing spirit assume a new form of life in keeping with them. For instance, a man following a particular profession becomes subject to dreams bearing on that profession. When the impression created by his actions in daily life is so deep as to induce dreams, his mind, even after death, leaves to his departing soul an inclination to be engaged in the subject of his mind&#8217;s last activities. This is <hi>v&#257;san&#257;</hi>.<note id="n107.a" n="A">A <hi>v&#257;san&#257;</hi> is the outcome of a person&#8217;s good or bad actions. It is not the last desire of a man as supposed by some, but the result of his good or bad actions or rather of the workings of his mind during life. It is believed that, if at the moment of death, a man&#8217;s mind is fixed on the strong attachment he feels for his children, he is born as a descendant of his offspring.&#8212;The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>It is a popular saying among Hindus that children inherit the nature of their parents. It is for this reason that high caste Hindus do not utter the names of their eldest sons. There is a further belief that the <hi>Pitriyas</hi> departed from the world with certain desires unfulfilled reappear as descendants of their children to have these desires satisfied.<note id="n107.4" n="4">The School Master of Kotd&#257; Sangani.</note>
</p><p>As the saying goes <hi>Pit&#257; putrena j&#257;yate</hi>, that is a father is born in the form of the <pb n="108"/>son, so the <hi>Pitriyas</hi> are born as descendants of their children, or according to the <hi>Bija vrikshany&#257;ya</hi>, as a tree springs from its seed, that is, its offerings, so parents take birth as children of their offspring.<note id="n108.1" n="1">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>The <hi>Pitriyas</hi>, whose attachment to their children or family or wealth does not die with them, reappear in the same family as descendants. It is also believed that persons dying with debts unpaid with the consciousness that they must be paid, are reborn in this world for the discharge of their obligations.<note id="n108.2" n="2">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>It is not always that the <hi>Purvajas</hi> reappear in the same family. It is said about the departed spirits, that after undergoing punishment for their sins and enjoying the fruits of their good actions, they come down on earth again as drops of rain, and forming part of the grain which grows on rain water make their way into the wombs of animals and are thus reborn.<note id="n108.3" n="3">The School Master of Mot&#257; Devali&#257;.</note>
</p><p>On account of the community of their feelings, habits and ideas in previous births, members of different families form different groups. The actions performed in this life keep them bound to one another either as recipients of the return of the obligations given in the past or as givers of fresh obligations. The members of a family stand thus to one another in the relation of debtors and creditors. It is for the discharge of these debts and recovery of dues that several individuals are united in a family. This naturally leads to the members of a family taking birth again in the same family for the proper discharge of debts.
</p><p>A virtuous child is declared to have been born to return the debts contracted in its past lives, and a vicious one to recover the dues.<note id="n108.4" n="4">The School Master of Char&#257;dwa.</note>
</p><p>When an <hi>atit</hi> or holy man or a recluse dies, his body is interred, and a platform rising waist high from the ground, or a small dome-shaped temple, is built over the spot. This is called a <hi>sam&#257;dh</hi>. An image of the god Shiva is generally installed in the <hi>sam&#257;dh</hi>; but sometimes <hi>p&#257;duk&#257;s</hi> <hi>i.e.</hi> the impressions on stone of the footsteps of the deceased, are installed instead. Instances of the latter are the <hi>p&#257;duk&#257;s</hi> of Datt&#257;traya, Gorakha and Machchendra N&#257;th.
</p><p>Both the <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> and the image of the god Shiva as well as the <hi>p&#257;duk&#257;s</hi> installed therein, are worshipped by the people, who, in course of time, give currency to the belief that the <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> possesses certain miraculous powers, such as curing long-standing diseases, blessing barren women with children, etc. Offerings are made to the <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> by pious persons and festivals or fairs are held in its honour by the inhabitants of the village in which the <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> is located.<note id="n108.5" n="5">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p><hi>Kabars</hi> or tombs raised over the graves of Mahomedan saints or <hi>Pirs</hi> are held in equal reverence both by Mahomedans and Hindus. To these offerings are made, and fairs are held in their honour.
</p><p>Some <hi>Sam&#257;dhs</hi> and <hi>Kabars</hi> noted for miraculous powers are given below.
</p><p>1. <hi>Gorakhn&#257;th</hi>:&#8212;The <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> of Gorakhn&#257;th lies on Mount Girn&#257;r. It is said that when the word <hi>Sal&#257;m</hi> is shouted by any one standing on the brink of the hollow wherein the <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> is said to be, the word &#8220;<hi>Aleka, Aleka, Aleka</hi>&#8221; is heard in response.<note id="n108.6" n="6">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk and the School Mistress of Gondal.</note>
</p><p>2. <hi>Kevald&#257;s</hi>:&#8212;The <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> of Kevald&#257;s stands in Susav&#257;v. It is told that, on one occasion, when a festival was being celebrated in honour of the B&#257;v&#257; Kevald&#257;s, a <hi>nimb</hi> tree (<foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio"><corr sic="Azadiarchta">Azadirachta</corr> Indica</foreign>) overhanging the <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> was transformed into a <hi>mitho Limbdo</hi> (<foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">Ailantas excelsa</foreign>).
</p><p>3. <hi>The Sam&#257;dh at K&#257;ng&#257;</hi>:&#8212;In the religious house at K&#257;ng&#257;, a village in the Jun&#257;gadh State, there lived a <hi>b&#257;v&#257;</hi> given to <pb n="109"/>religious austerities. It is said that he took <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi><note id="n109.a" n="A"><p>A <hi>sam&#257;dh</hi> is taken during life in the following way.
</p><p>A deep pit is dug in the ground. The person who wishes to take a <hi>sam&#257;dh</hi> goes into a deep trance by meditation, and then runs yelling and screaming to the pit, while drums are beaten furiously and a loud din is raised, so that none should hear a possible exclamation or cry from the runner. In the midst of this din the runner leaps into the pit and is covered over with salt and earth. An altar is raised over this spot <corr sic="wtth">with</corr> Shiva&#8217;s image, which afterwards becomes an object of worship. It is believed that if a word or a cry from the runner is heard while he is taking the leap, the whole village will be destroyed.&#8212;Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</p></note> during life. This <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> is said to work miracles at times.
</p><p>4. Similarly, a <hi>b&#257;v&#257;</hi> in the religious house at Nav&#257;nagar called <hi>Sh&#257;rad&#257; Matha</hi> has taken a <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> during life, and his remains and the structure over them have become an object of worship.
</p><p>5. <hi>The Sam&#257;dh of L&#257;l&#257; bhakta</hi>:&#8212;L&#257;l&#257; bhakta was a native of S&#257;yol&#257;. He was famous for his piety, and after his death his <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> was deified. It is said in reference to this <hi>Sam&#257;dh</hi> that a meal of dainty dishes prepared for five or six persons by its side, would satisfy the hunger of a company of fifty, if one happened to arrive there at the time of serving the meal<note id="n109.1" n="1">The P&#257;thsh&#257;l&#257; Sh&#257;stri, Bh&#257;y&#257;vadar.</note>.
</p><p>6. <hi>D&#257;t&#257;r<note id="n109.b" n="B">D&#257;t&#257;r means the great giver or munificent. The <hi>Pir</hi> is so called on account of his power of fulfilling the vows of many.</note> Pir</hi>:&#8212;The tomb of this Pir is situated on Mount Girn&#257;r. Almost all people in K&#257;thi&#257;w&#257;r and many from Gujar&#257;t offer vows to this Pir.<note id="n109.2" n="2">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>This Pir is also known by the name of K&#257;l&#257; Yavan.<note id="n109.3" n="3">The School Master of Movaiya.</note> It is believed that he has the power of releasing the chain bonds of a person falsely accused with an offence provided he approaches the <hi>Pir</hi> in chains. The sanctity of this <hi>Pir</hi> is so great that vows in his honour secure to persons desiring male heirs the birth of sons.<note id="n109.4" n="4">The School <corr sic="Master">Masters</corr> of Dh&#257;nk and Moti Parabdi.</note>
</p><p>7. <hi>As&#257;mi Pir</hi>:&#8212;The tomb of this <hi>Pir</hi> is in Lun&#257;r. He is believed to ensure the fulfilment of certain vows made by those who have faith in him.<note id="n109.5" n="5">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>8. <hi>Devalsh&#257; Pir</hi>:&#8212;The tomb of this <hi>Pir</hi> is situated at Amar&#257;n about seven miles from Todia. Many Hindus perform the first hair-cutting ceremony of their children at the shrine of this <hi>Pir</hi> with an offering of a sweet preparation of ghi, sugar or molasses, and wheat flour. The Muhammadans distribute cooked rice among the Fakirs about this shrine.
</p><p>A tradition runs that, once seven eunuchs defied the power of this <hi>Pir</hi> saying that they would put no faith in him unless they conceived sons. This they did, and when in terror regarding their approaching confinement, they were told that the children would have to be taken out by cutting their bodies open. The tombs of these seven eunuchs and their sons still stand near the tomb of Devalsh&#257; to bear testimony to his glory and miraculous power.<note id="n109.6" n="6">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>9. <hi>The Kabar of H&#257;ji Karm&#257;ni</hi>:&#8212;Is situated at Dw&#257;rk&#257;n and is much respected by both Hindus and Muhammadans.<note id="n109.7" n="7">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>10. <hi>The tombs of Jesal and Toral</hi>:&#8212;These are said to be the tombs of a husband and wife of the names of Jesal and Toral. They are situated in Anj&#257;r, a village in Cutch. It is said that originally these tombs were at the distance of twenty-seven feet from one another, but now the distance between them is only 7&#189; feet. A belief is current that the day of judgment will come when these two tombs meet.<note id="n109.8" n="8">The School Master of Davali&#257;.</note>
</p><p>11. <hi>H&#257;j Pir and Geb&#257;nsh&#257; Pir</hi>:&#8212;The tombs of these <hi>Pirs</hi> are at Mendard&#257;. Vows are offered to the H&#257;j Pir (Pilgrims saint) with the object of securing a good rainfall after an unusual drought, also for the restoration of stolen property. Vows to the <corr sic="Gebansh&#257;">Geb&#257;nsh&#257;</corr> Pir are believed to be efficacious in curing foot diseases of cattle and skin diseases of children.<note id="n109.9" n="9">The School Master of Mendard&#257;.</note>

A miracle is attributed to these tombs in the phenomenon that they can never be accurately measured, each attempt at measurement giving a different result. Women whose sons die in infancy make vows in honour of the Panch Pirs, and take them to their tombs on their attaining a certain age, where they observe <hi>fakiri</hi><note id="n110.a" n="A">A symbol of servitude of the saint.</note> for ten days.<note id="n110.1" n="1">The School Master of Sult&#257;npur.</note>
</p><p>13. <hi>Aulia Pir</hi><note id="n110.b" n="B"><hi>Aulia</hi> and <hi>Pir</hi>, synonymous terms, the first Arabic, the second Persian. Aulia is the Arabic plural of <hi>wali</hi> which means a saint. In Hindust&#257;ni the plural form is used to signify the singular e. g., a single <hi>wali</hi> or saint is often spoken of as an <hi>aulia</hi>. The word <hi>Pir</hi> originally meaning an old man is used in Hindust&#257;n in the sense of a saint. Aulia Pir is the Gujar&#257;ti for a single or many saints.</note>:&#8212;The tomb of this <hi>Pir</hi> lies on Mount Girn&#257;r. It is believed to possess the miraculous power of stopping the career of galloping horses and bringing them to the ground, and of stupefying the senses of a person who enters the shrine.<note id="n110.2" n="2">The School Master of Moti Porabdi.</note>
</p><p>14. <hi>Miran D&#257;t&#257;r</hi>:&#8212;The celebrated tomb of this Pir is in the village of Unjh&#257; near Baroda, where a fair is held every Friday in <hi>Shr&#257;van</hi>. Persons possessed by evil spirits are said to be cured by visiting this tomb and offering an image of a horse stuffed with cotton, and a cocoanut. People from all parts of Gujar&#257;t and from distant places suffering from physical infirmities, observe vows in honour of this <hi>Pir</hi>. Some wear iron wristlets round their wrists in his honour.<note id="n110.3" n="3">The School Master of Zinzuw&#257;d&#257;.</note>
</p><p>15. <hi>Pir M&#257;h&#257;bali</hi>:&#8212;The tomb of this <hi>Pir</hi> is situated at Gotark&#257; near R&#257;dhanpur. Every year a fair is held in honour of this tomb, when the chief Puj&#257;ri of the shrine of Varalu goes there, holding in one hand a bayonet with its point touching his breast, and in the other, a cocoanut. It is said that when the Puj&#257;ri reaches the third step leading to the entrance of the shrine, the locked doors of the shrine fly open, and the Puj&#257;ri throws the cocoanut into the shrine. If the shrine gates do not open of themselves on his approach, the <corr sic="Pujari">Puj&#257;ri</corr> has to stab himself to death then and there.<note id="n110.4" n="4">The School Master of Surel.</note>

In order to be efficacious, it must be taken on seven consecutive days commencing from the fourth day of the monthly menstrual period.<note id="n112.6" n="6">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>Conception is also believed to be favoured by administering the gum of the <hi>b&#257;bul</hi> tree dissolved in milk for three days commencing from the third day of the monthly period.<ref type="noteref" target="n112.6">[#6]</ref>
</p><p>Some believe that, in order to be effective, this mixture must be taken standing.<note id="n112.7" n="7">The School Master of Dadvi.</note> In some places, seeds of a vegetable plant called <hi>shivalangi</hi> are also administered.<ref type="noteref" target="n112.6">[#6]</ref>
</p><p>To secure conception, a bit of coral is also eaten, with the face turned towards the sun.<ref type="noteref" target="n112.6">[#6]</ref>
</p><p>Other preparations taken with the belief that they cause conception are:&#8212;

</p><p>It is also believed that if a barren woman succeeds in carrying away grains of rice from the folds of the upper garment of a pregnant woman, and eats them cooked in milk, her desire for a child is satisfied.<note id="n112.11" n="11">The School Master of Sult&#257;npur.</note>
</p><p>In celebrating the <hi>Sim&#257;nt</hi> or first pregnancy ceremony of a woman, the pregnant woman is taken for a bath to a dung-hill or to a distance of about thirty yards behind the house. After the bath is over, she returns home walking over sheets of cloth spread on her way. On this occasion her company is coveted by barren women for the purpose of tearing off unseen a piece of her upper garment, as this is believed to bring about conception. It is said that if a woman succeeds in doing this, she conceives, while the victim has a miscarriage.<note id="n112.12" n="12">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk and Mr. K. D. Desai.</note>
</p><p>Some believe that a slight pressure by a childless woman on the upper garment of a pregnant woman is sufficient to bring about the result mentioned above.<note id="n112.13" n="13">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>

</p><p>Conception is also said to be effected by branding children while at play in the streets.<note id="n113.2" n="2">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>It is believed that this brand, to have efficacy, must be inflicted on a Sunday or Tuesday.<ref type="noteref" target="n113.2">[#2]</ref> The operation is generally performed in the evening with a red-hot needle. It is said that the branded child dies while the branding barren woman conceives a child.<note id="n113.3" n="3">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note>
</p><p>Offering bread to black dogs is also supposed to be a cure for barrenness.
</p><p>Conception is also favoured by passing under the bier or palanquin holding the corpse of an ascetic or holy man while it is being carried to the cemetery.<note id="n113.4" n="4">The School Masters of Kotda Sangani and Chhatr&#257;sa.</note> Some believe that such an ascetic or saint must be a follower of the Jain faith.<note id="n113.5" n="5">The School Master of Jetpur.</note> Others maintain that the desired end can be secured only by wearing round the elbows the grains of rice or coins offered to the bier of a saint on its way to the cemetery.<note id="n113.6" n="6">The Deputy Educational Inspector, Gohilw&#257;d.</note>
</p><p>Other methods practised for the cure of barrenness are as follows:

</p><p>Some women collect the dust trodden on by a child-bearing woman in an earthen pot and eat it every day till it is exhausted.<ref type="noteref" target="n113.7">[#7]</ref>

</p><p>Others daub their foreheads with the blood emitted by a woman in menses.<ref type="noteref" target="n113.7">[#7]</ref>
</p><p>There are some who pour water in a circle at the village gate on a Sunday or Tuesday, and when in period, partake of the powder of <hi>mindhal</hi> mixed with <hi><corr sic="l&#225;psi">l&#257;psi</corr></hi> (coarse wheat flour fried in <hi>ghi</hi> and sweetened with molasses or sugar) seated on the threshold of the house.<note id="n113.8" n="8">The School Masters of Dadvi and Chhatr&#257;sa.</note>

Near the stream or well five small heaps of sand are made and daubed with red lead. Next, a lamp fed with <hi>ghi</hi> is lighted, and seven small betelnuts are offered to the <pb n="114"/>stream or well. A cocoanut is then broken, and a part of it is thrown into the water as an offering. Next, the woman fills a jar with the water of the stream or well and returns home, taking with her six out of the seven betelnuts offered to the stream or well. On her way home she is approached by barren women who request to be favoured with one of the betelnuts, as it is believed that swallowing such a betelnut causes conception.<note id="n114.1" n="1">The School Master of Todia.</note>
</p><p>Some believe that only the smallest of the seven betelnuts has the power of producing this result<note id="n114.2" n="2">The School Master of Mota Devalia.</note>.

</p><p>In some places, a black earthen pot containing charcoal and grains of <hi>adad</hi> (Phaseolus mungo) is placed on a spot where two roads cross one another, on a Sunday or Tuesday.

</p><p>Cutting off a lock of a child&#8217;s hair and keeping it in custody is also believed to satisfy the longing of a barren woman for a child. This result can also be obtained by securing a piece of a garment of a suckling child.
</p><p>Some worship daily a cocoanut and a betelnut consecrated with incantations.<note id="n114.6" n="6">The School Master of Khir&#257;sara.</note>
</p><p>Some take a bath on the third day of their period, and stand on the threshold of the house with their hair sprinkled over with <hi>kankotri</hi> (red powder).

</p><p>It is also believed that barrenness can be cured by religious vows, by offering alms in propitiation of malignant planets such as Mars, and by reciting the <hi>jap</hi> or incantation called <hi>gop&#257;l sant&#257;n</hi> to please the deity of that name.<note id="n114.8" n="8">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>

<pb n="115"/></p><p>Pouring water at the root of, or circumambulating, a <hi>pipal</hi> or <hi>b&#257;bul</hi> tree after a bath without removing the wet clothes, is also believed to cause conception.<note id="n115.1" n="1">The School Master of Chhatr&#257;sa.</note>

</p><p>Women whose children die in infancy give them opprobrious names such as Khacharo (filth), Ghelo (stupid), Natho, Uko, Ukardo, Bodho, Pujo, Ad&#257;vo, Mongho, Tulhi, Tutho, Kadavi, etc. in the belief that by so doing the life of the children is lengthened.<note id="n115.3" n="3">The School Master of Ganod.</note> The idea is almost Asiatic in extent. Among Musalm&#257;ns also such names are given; and even among the Persians and Arabs boys are given such names as Masriequ and Osaid&#8212;the Stolen and the Black. Sometimes parents arrange that their <corr sic="childern">children</corr> be actually stolen; and some next of kin, generally the aunt, is made to commit the kindly felony. She afterwards returns the child for a certain amount in cash or clothes. The custom is as old as the scriptures, there being an allusion in the Kor&#257;n to how the little Joseph was made to steal some garment of his aunt and was claimed as a forfeit by her. Speaking about Levi, the older brothers of Joseph say to the Egyptian soldiers, &#8220;If he hath stolen (the king&#8217;s goblet) verily the brother of his too did (formerly) steal.&#8221;

One of these is that memory of known facts or incidents heard or seen causes dreams. Dreams are also supposed to be caused by disorders in the brain, by brooding constantly over a particular occurrence, by anxiety or by the perpetration of sinful acts.<note id="n116.1" n="1">The School Master of Chhatr&#257;sa.</note> Those who are indebted to the <hi>pitris</hi> (ancestral spirits) are also said to be troubled by dreams.<note id="n116.2" n="2">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note> A hearty meal at night just before going to bed is also supposed to cause dreams.<note id="n116.3" n="3">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>There are three conditions of human existence, (1) <hi>J&#257;griti</hi> that is wakefulness (2) <hi>Swapna</hi> that is dream and (3) <hi>Sushupti</hi> that is sleep. The incidents which impress the mind strongly during wakefulness are reproduced in dreams. Very often thoughts that never occur to our minds strike us in dreams. These are ascribed to the impressions made on the soul during past lives.<note id="n116.4" n="4">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>It is said that the interpretation of dreams goes by contraries. But at times they are fully borne out. A good dream is an indication of future good, and a bad one of future evil.<note id="n116.5" n="5">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>There are some persons whose dreams are always fulfilled. Dreams dreamt by persons pure of mind and heart seldom turn out false.
</p><p>Dreams occurring in the first quarter of the night are believed to be fulfilled in a year, those in the second quarter of the night in six months, those in the third quarter in three months, and those in the last quarter in one month. A dream seen during an hour and a half before daybreak bears fruit in ten days, while that seen just at day-break is realised immediately.<note id="n116.6" n="6">The School Master of Chhatr&#257;sa.</note>
</p><p>Dreams that occur before midnight are never fulfilled.<note id="n116.7" n="7">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>If a person has a bad dream, he should go to sleep at once, and not communicate it to any one. If he has a good dream, he should not sleep on that night after its occurrence. Early on the following morning he should communicate it to a preceptor or saint; but if neither be available, he should repeat it into the ears of a cow. A good dream should never be told to a bad or low-minded person.
</p><p>If a man sleeps after a good dream and has a bad one, the former loses its force while the latter gains ascendancy and comes true.<note id="n116.8" n="8">The School Master of Chhatr&#257;sa.</note>
</p><p>It is related that All&#257;uddin the bloody once entered the house of a blacksmith when the latter was asleep dreaming that he saw a treasure trove after having bathed in a stream and drunk a little water. At the same time All&#257;uddin saw a small insect come <pb n="117"/>out of the blacksmith&#8217;s nostril, drink water from a neighbouring cistern, and return to the place from whence he came. When the dream was over, the blacksmith woke and communicated it to All&#257;uddin, which enabled the latter to spot the treasure, found by excavating the place where the insect was hidden.<note id="n117.1" n="1">The School Master of <corr sic="Dh&#225;nk">Dh&#257;nk</corr>.</note>
</p><p>The king Nala was questioned in his sleep several times by an individual unknown to him, &#8220;May I come now or later?&#8221; Nala replied &#8220;Come now&#8221; thinking that if it was misfortune that put him the question, it would be better to get rid of it soon, so that the latter part of life might be passed happily. The questioner proved to be misfortune, and it is related that Nala met many mishaps during his youth.<ref type="noteref" target="n117.1">[#1]</ref>

</p><p>&#8220;If a cow, a horse, an elephant, a king or a flower called <hi>prashasta</hi> is seen in a dream by a sickly person, his illness disappears; if by one laid in sick bed, he is cured; if by one confined in a jail, he is released.&#8221;<note id="n118.1" n="1">The Shastri, Bh&#257;y&#257;vadar P&#257;thash&#257;la.</note>

</p><p>Another instance of the soul departing and then returning to the body is that of a Kanbi woman in Lil&#257;pur, whose soul returned to the body after she had been carried to the burning ground. The woman lived for five years after this occurrence.<note id="n119.3" n="3">The School Master of Lil&#257;pur.</note>
</p><p>A Br&#257;hman in Limbdi named Vaijn&#257;th had, by the performance of <hi>yoga</hi>, obtained the power of sending his spirit out of his body and recalling it at pleasure.<note id="n119.4" n="4">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>The soul of a living being leaves its physical tabernacle during sleep and hovers about. It can go to and return from even the heavenly and infernal regions.
</p><p>There are eighteen kinds of <hi>siddhis</hi> or accomplishments, one of which is <hi>parak&#257;y&#257;pravesh</hi> or the power of entering the body of another and returning to one&#8217;s own body at will. The soul cannot exist separated from the body. When a person who revives after death is asked how he returned to life, he declares that he has been carried to the presence of the god of death by his messengers, being mistaken for another bearing the same name and living in the same locality. When such a mistake is detected, the god of death tells the soul of the man concerned that his life&#8217;s span has not yet ended, and sends it back to the body, which appears to be dead.<note id="n119.5" n="5">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>Often the soul of a man ascends to his temples, when the man is supposed to be dead although he is alive. In such cases, when the soul descends, the man is supposed to come to life again.
</p><p>It is believed by some people that if all the desires of a man are not satisfied at the time of his death, his soul leaves the body to satisfy them and subsequently returns to the corpse, whereupon the body revives.<note id="n119.6" n="6">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>A devotee in his meditative trance can send forth his soul whithersoever he pleases.<note id="n119.7" n="7">The School Master of Kolki.</note>
</p><p>It is also believed that the soul of man leaves the body in sleep to enjoy those pleasures which it cannot enjoy in wakefulness.<note id="n119.8" n="8">The School Master of Mojid&#257;d.</note>
</p><p>The popular conceptions of the character and functions of the <hi>bhut</hi> or disembodied soul are as follows:
</p><p>A ghost has no recognised form. It may assume the form of a human being, a goat, a blaze of fire, a whirl-wind or any other object it pleases.<note id="n119.9" n="9">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>Some assume a terribly gigantic and fearfully uncouth frame, with big fang-like <pb n="120"/>teeth, long matted hair and a height that reaches the sky. At times they assume the form of a child and cry heart-breakingly at a concealed corner of a road. Should a passer-by, out of compassion, try to save it, the supposed infant begins to lengthen its legs to show its benefactor its real and supernatural dimensions. Sometimes it transforms itself into a gigantic and terrible being, taking possession of the man if he becomes afraid.<note id="n120.1" n="1">The School Master of Kolki.</note>
</p><p>Some evil spirits manifest themselves as showers of burning charcoal, while some are so forward as to offer their services as guides to strangers from one village to another. Some assume the form of <hi>Bhens&#257;sur</hi>&#8212;a demon in the form of a buffalo&#8212;said to be a most malignant ghost.<note id="n120.2" n="2">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>The throat of a ghost is as narrow as the fine end of a needle, and yet it is believed to require a dozen potfuls of water to quench its thirst. It cannot get pure water, as such water is guarded by the god Varuna. It has, therefore, to quench its thirst with such dirty water as it can get. Similarly, it cannot get clean food, and has to satisfy its hunger on human excretions, the droppings of birds and other animals, urine, and the filth of houses.<note id="n120.3" n="3">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>It is generally believed that evil spirits do not cast shadows. All attempts to catch them prove futile, as they vanish in the form of a flame.<note id="n120.4" n="4">The School Master of B&#257;ntva.</note>
</p><p>If it is sought to catch hold of a goat-shaped ghost, the goat swells into such a monstrous size that the spectator gets terrified, whereupon the ghost finds an opportunity of disappearing in a flame.
</p><p>It is believed that ghosts prefer darkness to light and silence to noise. They live on the <hi>Pipal</hi> (<foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">Ficus religiosa</foreign>) or <hi>Shami</hi> (<foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">Prosopis spicigera</foreign>) trees.<note id="n120.5" n="5">The School Masters of S&#257;nka and Songadh<corr>.</corr></note>
</p><p>A ghost presents itself to the vision of a man by blocking its way in the form of a goat or some other animal.<note id="n120.6" n="6">The School Master of Char&#257;dva.</note>
</p><p>Ghosts are believed to infest woods, unused wells, cellars and old tanks. They are also found in ruins and cemeteries. As far as possible they keep themselves aloof from mortals; but at times they are visible to human beings, mostly to those destitute of religion and morals. They roam about and terrify people. Sometimes they enter the persons of human beings. Such men either gain in strength, fall sick, or become senseless. The ghosts who possess them make them laugh or work, without being fatigued, with ten times the vigour they originally possessed.<note id="n120.7" n="7">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>Ghosts keep their persons uncovered, feed upon flesh and blood, sleep during the day, and roam about at night.<note id="n120.8" n="8">The School Master of Kotda Sangani.</note>
</p><p>Often a large concourse of ghosts meet together and dance, sing and make merry uttering loud and fierce shrieks. A ghost has no back, and has its feet reversed. It keeps away from man, but terrifies him by pelting him with stones from a distance.<note id="n120.9" n="9">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>On the fourteenth day of the dark half of <hi><corr sic="A&#347;hvin">&#256;shvin</corr></hi> (the twelfth month of the Gujar&#257;ti Hindu year) all ghosts are believed to go about playing pranks with poor mortals and possessing them.<note id="n120.10" n="10">The School Master of Kolki.</note>
</p><p>The <hi>Navar&#257;tra</hi> holidays is the season when ghosts appear in many places.<note id="n120.11" n="11">The School Master of Lil&#257;pur.</note>
</p><p>Ghosts enter corpses or possess human beings and speak through them as a medium. Sometimes they assume their original human form, and often torment people with disease. <pb n="121"/>They present themselves as animals and pass away in a blaze. They hum in the air without being seen, wrestle with men or carry unseen human beings from one place to another. Some women are believed to conceive by intercourse with male ghosts.<note id="n121.1" n="1">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>If a man happens to step in the circle described by water round the offering given to a ghost, viz., <hi>ut&#257;r</hi>, he is possessed by the ghost. A house haunted by a ghost is the scene of great mischief.<note id="n121.2" n="2">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>Ghosts are said to be most mischievous during the first part of the night. Their fury diminishes with the advance of night.<note id="n121.3" n="3">The School Master of Kolki<corr>.</corr></note>
</p><p>Ghosts are inimical to human beings, terrify them, and sometimes, assuming the form of a cobra, kill those whom they hated most during life.<note id="n121.4" n="4">The School Master of Oman.</note>
</p><p>They are pleased with offerings of blood.<note id="n121.5" n="5">The School Master of Khir&#257;sara.</note>
</p><p>To throw stones at houses and trees and to set them on fire are their usual pranks.<note id="n121.6" n="6">The School Master of R&#257;jp&#257;ra.</note>
</p><p>The ghost called <hi>J&#257;n</hi> manifests itself as a giant, its height reaching the sky. If a man comes under its shadow, he is seized by it and dashed to pieces on the ground. On the contrary, if a man wins its favour, he becomes prosperous. Hence a proverb has been current that &#8220;seizing another as by a <hi>j&#257;n</hi>&#8221; meaning &#8220;being attacked by a dire misfortune.&#8221;<note id="n121.a" n="A">The word <hi>J&#257;n</hi> is the plural of the Arabic <hi>jinni</hi>. It has remained as a relic of Arab supremacy and occupation of the Kathi&#257;w&#257;r coast just in the beginning of Isl&#257;m during its first conquests&#8212;about half a century after the <corr sic="Prophets&#8217;">Prophet&#8217;s</corr> death.</note>
</p><p>There is a female ghost called <hi>Chudel</hi>. Its back is covered with flesh, its feet are reversed, its form is hollow and its face handsome like that of a charming woman.<note id="n121.7" n="7">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note><corr sic="."/>
</p><p>It is said that a woman dying in childbed becomes a <hi>chudel</hi>. Her form is a skeleton behind with the figure of a pretty woman in front.
</p><p>It is believed that mastery over ghosts can be obtained by dint of incantations or <hi>mantras</hi>. Those who subjugate ghosts in this way have power to command them to do their behests. But the process by which such powers are procured is believed to be beset with dangers, and many lose their lives in so doing.<note id="n121.8" n="8">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>There is also a belief that a <hi>bhut</hi> or ghost can be brought under control by lopping off a lock of its hair or top knot and keeping it in one&#8217;s custody.<note id="n121.9" n="9">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>It is said that this lock ought to be kept inside the right thigh by tearing a hole in the flesh. It is believed that the thigh can be cut open by a hair of the ghost without injury.<note id="n121.10" n="10">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note>
</p><p>The ghost so subjugated should never be kept unemployed; otherwise it oppresses its master.<note id="n121.11" n="11">The School Master of Gondal.</note>
</p><p>It is believed that the spirits of deceased persons become ghosts under the following conditions:&#8212;
</p><p>1 If scriptural ceremonies are not performed with the ceremonial offerings of rice balls to the deceased.
</p><p>2 If the deceased dies with a strong attachment to worldly objects.
</p><p>3 If the death is unnatural that is, caused by an accident.
</p><p>All ghosts get absolution by the performance of propitiative ceremonies by their descendants as prescribed in the scriptures.<note id="n121.12" n="12">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>There are various beliefs current as to the state of the soul after death. The <hi>Garud pur&#257;n</hi> contains many passages illustrating its movements after it leaves the body. Says the book:&#8212;
</p><p>&#8220;When the soul leaves the body it assumes a form as small as a thumb. At this very <pb n="122"/>moment it is caught by the servants of Yama while he is crying out ha! ha! looking at its corporal receptacle.&#8221;
</p><p>And again:&#8212;
</p><p>&#8220;Covering the body of the soul (which suffers intensely) and strangling it forcibly, the servants of the god Yama carry it away just as a culprit is carried by a king&#8217;s soldiers.&#8221;
</p><p>The verses that follow describe the miseries inflicted upon the poor thumb-shaped soul for the sins committed by him during his life-time. The sinful soul has to undergo similar miseries in hell. From hell it returns to this world guarded by the servants of Yama, to partake of the rice-balls and other articles of food offered by the sons or other relatives. It is then again taken to hell to suffer more miseries and penalties in expiation of past sins. Then it returns once more to receive the offerings of rice-balls made at <hi>shr&#257;ddha</hi> ceremonies. If, even after this, any desires remain unfulfilled, it has to continue a wretched existence in the other world.<note id="n122.1" n="1">The Sh&#257;stri, Bh&#257;y&#257;vadar P&#257;thsh&#257;la<corr>.</corr></note>
</p><p>In a chapter of the <hi>Pretamanjari</hi> of the <hi>Garud Pur&#257;n</hi> it is stated that the souls of righteous men go to the next world unmolested.<note id="n122.2" n="2">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>Some people believe that the departing soul assumes a form like a thumb, and remains in that state until relieved by the performance of <hi>shr&#257;ddha</hi> by his heirs. It then enters the other world to enjoy the fruits of its good actions. The <hi>Yamapuri</hi> or the city of the god of death is 8,6&#180;0 <hi>Y&#333;jans</hi>&#8212;a <hi>Y&#333;jan</hi> being equal to four miles&#8212;to the south of the earth. The lord of this place is Dharmar&#257;ja. Yama is his servant, whose duty is to carry the soul from one place to another.<note id="n122.3" n="3">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>Others maintain that two states await the soul after death according to whether it has performed righteous or sinful acts during life.
</p><p>The righteous attain to heaven and enter the <hi>P&#257;rshad Vaikunta</hi> of Vishnu. The sinful go to hell or <hi>Yamaloka</hi>.<note id="n122.4" n="4">The D. E. Inspector, H&#257;l&#257;r.</note>
</p><p>The sinful souls go to <hi>Yamaloka</hi> and are made to suffer the miseries of twenty-eight <hi>naraks</hi> or hells in proportion to the sins perpetrated by them, after which they return to the earth.
</p><p>The following are some of the punishments meted out to wicked souls for their sins, in their next lives:&#8212;
</p><p>1 Those who murder Br&#257;hmans suffer from consumption.
</p><p>2 Those who slaughter cows are born as tortoises.
</p><p>3 Those guilty of female infanticide suffer from white leprosy.
</p><p>4 One who kills his wife, as well as a woman guilty of causing abortion, becomes a beggar.
</p><p>5 Those who commit adultery become impotent.
</p><p>6 He who seats himself on the bed or seat of his preceptor is affected by skin diseases.
</p><p>7 Flesh-eaters get a red body.
</p><p>8 Those who indulge in drink get black teeth.
</p><p>9 A Br&#257;hman partaking of prohibited food suffers from dropsy.
</p><p>10 One who eats sweets without sharing them with the by-standers suffers from cancer in the throat.
</p><p>11 One who offers polluted food to departed spirits suffers from black leprosy.
</p><p>12 One who disobeys and despises his teacher suffers from wind <hi>apasm&#257;r</hi>.
</p><p>13 One who does not believe in the <hi>sh&#257;stras</hi> suffers from enlargement of the spleen or Bright&#8217;s disease.
</p><p>14 A perjurer is born dumb.
<pb n="123"/></p><p>15 One who does not serve food equally to all the members at a dining table loses one of his eyes.
</p><p>16 Those who break off a marriage alliance are punished with thick (negro-like) lips.
</p><p>17 Those who steal books lose their eye-sight.
</p><p>18 He who kicks a Br&#257;hman becomes lame.
</p><p>19 A liar becomes a stammerer.
</p><p>20 Those who listen to contradictory versions of what is generally believed to be true become deaf.

</p><p>26 He who steals food is born a mouse.
</p><p>27 One stealing corn has to be reborn as a locust.
</p><p>28 One stealing opium or other poisonous drugs is born a scorpion.
</p><p>29 One who steals leaves or vegetables is born a peacock.
</p><p>30 One who enjoys perfumes by stealing them is born a mole.
</p><p>31 One who steals honey becomes an eagle.
</p><p>32 One who steals flour, rice, etc. is born a monkey.<note id="n123.1" n="1">The Sh&#257;stri, P&#257;thsh&#257;la, Bh&#257;y&#257;vadar.</note>
</p><p>The state of the soul after death depends upon a man&#8217;s good or bad actions in life.
</p><p>The souls of the righteous leave the body without any trouble. The messengers of the god of death present themselves to these souls in the form of saints and carry them to that part of the heaven which is presided over by their favourite deity, by the eastern, northern, or western gates. They are received there with great respect. Here they enjoy the fruits of their merit, after which they return to this world and are born either in the family of a wealthy virtuous man or in that of a poor Br&#257;hman who has attained the knowledge of God. In this new life they accumulate further merit, in virtue of which they are endowed with a higher spiritual life in the following birth, and so on until they attain final emancipation.
</p><p>After attaining <hi>moksha</hi> or salvation the soul becomes free from the wheel of birth and rebirth.
</p><p>To the souls of the sinful, who leave their bodies with a great struggle, the messengers of the god of death present themselves in a terrible form. They are carried to hell by the southern gate, being constantly lashed on the way. There they are relegated to one of the twenty-eight pits (of hell) appropriate to their misdeeds, to suffer retribution for their sins.<note id="n123.2" n="2">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>The soul is carried to Dharmar&#257;ja after it leaves the body. Thence, with the permission of the god, it returns to this world and halts for thirteen days at the threshold of its house. On the thirteenth day an earthen jar filled with water is emptied on a <hi>pipal</hi> tree (<foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">Ficus religiosa</foreign>) after which its connection with this world ceases. Then it returns to the heavenly judge of actions (Dharmar&#257;ja), and is again born in the species prescribed by him. The soul of a strictly spiritual being merges into the divine entity and becomes free from birth and rebirth.
</p><p><hi>Moksha</hi> or <hi>Mukti</hi>, that is final emancipation is of two kinds, <hi>s&#257;yujya</hi> or merging into the divine form and <hi>s&#257;mishya</hi> or entering the divine order and living in this state so long as one&#8217;s merits allow.<ref type="noteref" target="n123.2">[#2]</ref>
</p><p>Dharmar&#257;ja keeps an account of the good and bad actions of all men in his book <pb n="124"/>called <hi>siddhi karan</hi>, and dispenses justice according to it. A man guilty of adultery is sentenced to embrace a redhot image of a woman; one who has slaughtered animals is devoured by those animals; while those who have committed the sin of murdering Br&#257;hmans are relegated to hell for ever.<note id="n124.1" n="1">The School Mistress, Barton Female Training College, R&#257;jkot.</note>
</p><p>There are seven rungs to the ladder which leads to the next world. The first is covered with a thick forest. The second bristles with pointed spears. The third is strewn with <hi>gokharu</hi> (a species of thorns). The fourth has piercing blasts. On the fifth runs the river Vaitarna. The sixth is full of red-hot iron. The seventh is covered with deep streams.<note id="n124.2" n="2">The School Master of Limbdi.</note>
</p><p>After death, the soul has to cross the river Vaitarna (<hi>vide</hi> the fifth rung above) on its way to the next world. Those who have given cows in charity can cross this river without difficulty by holding the tails of the cows, who present themselves to help them.
</p><p>Those who have given shoes in charity can tread the third step with ease.

Virtuous women are born as goddesses or <hi>devis</hi> or as <hi>apsar&#257;s</hi> or celestial songstresses.

The latter have also to cross large rivers and pass through streams filled with blood and puss. As they pass, eagles prey upon their bodies and they are bitten by venomous snakes.<note id="n124.5" n="5">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>The souls of those who have in life performed good actions pass through the sun and assume divine forms; while those of ordinary beings pass through the moon and return to this world.<note id="n124.6" n="6">The School Master of Jetalpur.</note>
</p><p>A sinful soul has to go to <hi>Yamaloka</hi> or hell through sixteen cities. On its way it has to cross the river Vaitarna, which consists of blood mixed with puss. He who has presented a cow to a Br&#257;hman can cross this river with ease. Beyond this river lies a land which is covered with spikes. Those who have given in charity <hi>ashtamah&#257;d&#257;n</hi>, that is, sesamum seeds, flour, gold, cotton, salt, clarified butter, milk and sugarcandy, can walk over this ground without being hurt. When the soul has reached Yama or the god of death, the sun and the moon, the ever-living witnesses of human actions, <pb n="125"/>testify to its virtues and sins, and it is meted out a punishment appropriate to its sins.<note id="n125.1" n="1">The D.

</p><p>In order that the departed soul may not find its way difficult, his heirs make a gift to a Br&#257;hman of a bedstead, bedding, a lamp, corn, a pair of shoes and other articles, on the thirteenth day after death.

</p><p>Their souls are said to be liable to enter the <hi>asurgati</hi> or the order of devils.

</p><p>In the case of suicides, when the crime is proved before the god of death the culprit is hurled into a hell called <hi>Mah&#257;raurava</hi>, where he has to pass a thousand years. After the expiry of this period he is born again into this world, again commits suicide, and again meets the same fate after death.

</p><p>To drive away an evil spirit from the body of a person, a conjuror, V&#257;njha, Koli<corr>,</corr> V&#257;ghri, Atit, Fakir or other exorcist is engaged to set a <hi>d&#257;nkl&#257;n</hi><note id="n126.a" n="A">See p. 3.</note> and to offer a victim and frankincense to the evil spirit, which is supposed to drive the spirit out by the same route by which it entered the body.<note id="n126.b" n="B">If a lock of the hair of the person possessed by an evil spirit be knotted round and round while the exorcist is trying to cast the spirit, it cannot get out.&#8212;The School Master of Vanod.</note><note id="n126.9" n="9">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>Another method of driving away an evil spirit from the body is as follows:&#8212;
</p><p>As soon as it is ascertained that a man is possessed by an evil spirit, somebody catches hold of the top-knot of the man or ties it into a knot. Next he is lashed with a whip or chain until the ghost in him cries out &#8220;Please don&#8217;t beat me. I shall leave the body and shall never return.&#8221; Then the ghost is told that it is a liar, that it said a thousand times that it would leave the body and not return, but it did not do it. No faith, therefore, would be put in its word. After a haggling dialogue of this kind and on the ghost&#8217;s confirmation of its offer never to return by some satisfactory oath or assurance, the top-knot is unloosed and the ghost disappears.<note id="n126.10" n="10">Mr. K.

</p><p>A third method is to subject the person possessed to the fumes of red chillies or of black wood, or to tie a sacred thread round his elbow.
</p><p>After one of these <corr sic="processess">processes</corr> has been performed to expel the ghost, the victim gives a deep yawn, and it is said that the ghost goes out in the yawn. Next the relieved person is given water to drink, and an exorcist is engaged to take measures to prevent the possibility of the ghost&#8217;s return.<note id="n126.11" n="11">The School Master of P&#257;tan V&#257;o.</note>
</p><p>In a book entitled <hi>Br&#257;hman Nighanta Ratn&#257;kar</hi> is described the method of driving away an evil spirit from the body of a man by an offering of <hi>dhup</hi> or frankincense.

</p><p>There are various superstitious beliefs entertained by people regarding sneezing.
</p><p>According to one belief, if a person sneezes face to face with another who is about to begin an auspicious act, such as starting on a journey, decking his person with ornaments, performing a marriage ceremony, and the like, it portends misfortune to the latter; but a sneeze on his right or at his back foretells good. A sneeze in front of a person starting to perform an auspicious act is supposed to mean that a blow has been struck on his forehead, suggesting that the act should be stopped. If, in spite of this warning, the act is commenced, evil consequences are sure to follow.
</p><p>A sneeze at a man&#8217;s back confirms the unobstructed fulfilment of the act taken in hand, as it is believed to have patted the man on his back or shoulders in token of approval.
</p><p>Sneezes on either side, right or left, portend neither good nor evil.
</p><p>As a rule, sneezes are believed to forebode evil, and it is considered highly unmannerly to sneeze while one is about to begin an auspicious act or start with a good purpose. If, in spite of this etiquette, one sneezes, he excuses himself by saying that he is suffering from cold.<note id="n127.2" n="2">The School Master of Kotda Sangani.</note>
</p><p>Some people believe that a sneeze in front is an indication of a broil on the road, a sneeze on the left side portends loss of money, one from above is a harbinger of success, one from below foretells danger, while the sneeze of the man who is engaged or is starting on the act contemplated is believed to be very injurious. A sneeze on the right is considered neither good nor bad.<note id="n127.3" n="3">The School Master of S&#257;nka.</note>
</p><p>A sneeze in the east causes anxiety, in the south-east foretells happiness, in the south speaks of coming loss, and in the south-west is an indication of good. A sneeze from the west or north-west is considered good, from the north injurious, and from the <corr sic="east">north-east</corr> auspicious.<note id="n127.4" n="4">The School Master of Kolki.</note>
</p><p>Some lines from the sayings of Gorakhr&#257;j run to the effect that a sneeze in the east causes anxiety, one in the south-east inflicts a sound beating, one in the south brings a visitor or guest, one in the south-west subjects the person concerned to a taunt, one in the west bestows a throne or crown, one in the north-west promises sweets or dainties, one in the north foretells good, one in the north-east brings disappointment, while one&#8217;s own sneeze is so ominous that one should never start out on any business after sneezing.<note id="n127.5" n="5">The School Master of Chhar&#257;dva.</note>
</p><p>The beliefs enumerated above relate to sneezes which occur on certain week days. The sneezes which occur on Sundays have the following consequences.
</p><p>A sneeze from the east is good, one from the south-east points to delay in the fulfilment of one&#8217;s intended object, one from the south brings in profit, one from the south-west results in death, one from the west in happiness, one from the north-west throws one into the society of good men, one from the north is <pb n="128"/>productive of pecuniary gain, and one from the north-east of general wellbeing.<note id="n128.1" n="1">The School Master of Limbdi.</note>
</p><p>It is a common belief that if while one is about to commence some act, somebody sneezes once, the act is doomed to fail, and to avoid failure it must be postponed. But if the sneeze is repeated, no harm ensues.<ref type="noteref" target="n128.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>A sneeze by an ailing person is believed to be a sign of his recovery, and more sneezes by the same person are supposed to indicate his complete recovery, even though the symptoms be not favourable.
</p><p>A sneeze by a cow at the commencement of an auspicious act is supposed to be the worst possible omen, and a sneeze by a cat is proverbially a portent of failure in any act taken in hand at the time.<note id="n128.2" n="2">The School Master of Jhinjhuw&#257;da.</note>
</p><p>A yawn is generally believed to be harmless, as it does not foretell either good or evil. Still as sometimes it results in accidental instantaneous death, the elders of a person when he yawns, exclaim, &#8220;Be long-lived! Patience! Live long!&#8221;, and the spiritually disposed repeat the name of the god of their devotion.<note id="n128.3" n="3">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>Lest spirits may make their way into the body of a person through his mouth when he is yawning, or lest his soul may pass out of it, some people pinch him to stop the yawn while others utter the words &#8220;R&#257;m&#8221; &#8220;R&#257;m&#8221; to divert his attention.<note id="n128.4" n="4">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>

</p><p>The evil eye causes its victim to vomit what he has eaten in its presence.<note id="n134.4" n="4">The School Master of Chhatr&#257;sa.</note>
</p><p>If a child weeps all day long, or a person finds his appetite very weak, the evil is attributed to an evil eye.<note id="n134.5" n="5">The School Master of Jetpur.</note>
</p><p>If milch cattle do not give milk, or if <hi>seva</hi> (vermicelli)<corr>,</corr> <hi>p&#257;pad</hi> (wafer biscuits)<corr>,</corr> pickles, <hi>dudhp&#257;k</hi> (rice cooked in milk and sweetened with sugar) or such other eatables are spoilt, it is believed that the evil eye is at the root of the trouble.<note id="n134.6" n="6"> The School Master of Devalia.</note>
</p><p>It is believed that the following objects are liable to be influenced by an evil eye:&#8212;
</p><p>(1) Persons having fine glossy hair, fiery eyes, exquisite form, refined gait, fine speech or good handwriting, (2) good sportsmen, (3), pickles, (4) <hi>p&#257;pad</hi> (wafer biscuits), (5) <hi><corr sic="Seva">seva</corr></hi> (vermicelli), (6) all attractive objects<corr>.</corr>
</p><p>If a person falls ill after he is praised, he is said to have been a victim of an evil eye.<note id="n134.7" n="7">The School Master of S&#257;yala.</note>
</p><p>The precautions taken to evade the influence of the evil eye are as follows:&#8212;
</p><p>(1) When children are dressed and decked with ornaments, a spot is made on their cheeks or near their necks with a black pigment or collyrium, as it is believed that the dark colour is an antidote against the influence of the evil eye.
</p><p>(2) Some efficacious inscription is engraved on a copper plate, which is suspended round the child&#8217;s neck.
</p><p>(3) A bead of <hi>kachakada</hi> is also worn round the neck.
</p><p>(4) A tiger&#8217;s nail or tooth is worn round the neck.

</p><p>(6) A lime is worn in the turban or headdress.
</p><p>(7) An incantation in the praise of Hanum&#257;n is written on a piece of paper and put in an anklet which is worn.
</p><p>(8) A piece of thread of five kinds of silk or cotton spun by a virgin is given seven knots on the fourteenth day of the dark half of <hi><corr sic="&#193;shvin">&#256;shvin</corr></hi> and worn on the person.
</p><p>(9) In order that sweet meats and other eatables such as <hi>p&#257;pad</hi> (wafer biscuits), pickles, etc., may not be spoilt by an evil eye, a lime, an iron nail or a knife is put into them.
</p><p>(10) In order that a cot or cradle may not be broken by the influence of an evil eye, a black woollen thread is tied round it.
</p><p>(11) To prevent <hi><corr sic="dudhb&#257;k">dudhp&#257;k</corr></hi> (rice cooked in milk and sweetened with sugar) from being spoilt, a piece of charcoal is put into the pot in which it is prepared.<note id="n134.8" n="8">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>While taking one&#8217;s meal one should avoid the company of an evil-eyed person, but if perchance one <corr sic="happen">happens</corr> to be present, a morsel of the food should be thrown behind him or <pb n="135"/>set aside on the ground as an offering to the evil eye.<note id="n135.1" n="1">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i<corr>.</corr></note>
</p><p>If, in spite of the precautions mentioned above, the influence of the evil eye prevails, the following remedies are adopted to remove its effects:&#8212;
</p><p>(1) The evil eye is fastened or curbed, as they say, by one of the processes described in Chapter III above.
</p><p>(2) A red-hot charcoal is placed on a dinner plate and covered with an earthen jar. A bowl filled with water is then passed round the head of the patient, emptied over the jar and placed on it with its mouth touching the jar. Next, a scythe is placed over the bowl. The jar, which is heated with the heat of the burning charcoal placed under it produces a hissing sound as soon as it is touched by the water in the bowl, and is said to speak. This process is called <hi>Ghadulo</hi> and is performed after sunset.<note id="n135.2" n="2">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>In some places, it is a belief that the plate to be used in this process must be of bell-metal, and that over the fire placed in it mustard seeds, chillies and salt must be thrown before it is covered with the earthen jar.<note id="n135.3" n="3">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>(3) An <hi>ut&#257;r</hi><note id="n135.a" n="A">See page 3.</note> or sacrificial offering is taken to the village gate on a Sunday or Tuesday.
</p><p>(4) Milk is passed three or seven times round the head of the ailing child, poured into a black earthen pot, and offered to a black bitch on a Sunday or Tuesday.<note id="n135.4" n="4">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>(5) The mother or some other near relative of the child suffering from the effects of the evil eye, puts in a bell-metal cup mustard seed, salt, chillies and seven stones from the village gate, passes the cup thrice round the child&#8217;s head, puts burning charcoal in the cup, and after it is heated, places it overturned in a bell-metal pot and pours over it water mixed with cowdung, so that the cup adheres to the pot. This sticking of the cup is called <hi lang="gu-latn" xml:lang="gu-latn">najar chonti gai</hi> (the evil eye has stuck fast) and is believed to cure the child.<note id="n135.5" n="5">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>(6) An exorcist is engaged to wave a bowl filled with water round the head of the patient. He then drinks off the water, and the patient believes that the disease has been drunk with it.<note id="n135.6" n="6">The School Master of Kotda Sangani.</note>
</p><p>(7) A handful of salt and chillies is passed thrice round the head of the patient and thrown into the fire. If the chillies burn without giving out fumes of an unpleasant odour, the evil eye is believed to be at the root of the illness.<note id="n135.b" n="B">This process is generally adopted in cases of milch cattle not giving milk and all other ailments to ascertain the influence of the evil eye.</note><note id="n135.7" n="7">Mr. K.

</p><p>(8) A little dust collected from a spot where two roads cross one another, or red lead and oil offered to Hanum&#257;n, a red chilly, an iron nail and grains of <hi>adad</hi> (Phaseolus mungo) are packed into a piece of white cotton cloth with a black woollen thread, and tied to the cradle of the suffering child.<note id="n135.8" n="8">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>(9) A side of a loaf of millet flour is baked by being exposed to fire, clarified butter is applied to this side, and a fine cotton thread is passed round the loaf.

</p><p>Sometimes the loaf is offered to a black dog after it has been waved round the child&#8217;s head.<ref type="noteref" target="n135.8">[#8]</ref>

</p><p>Some people throw a newly-born child on a dung-hill and take it back, saying that they found it on the dung-hill, with the belief that a child of such low origin cannot be snatched away from them by Fate. Such children are named Punjio, Unkardo or Kacharo meaning &#8216;dung-hill.&#8217;
</p><p>Some children are named Khoto, Amatho or Jutho, all meaning &#8216;false&#8217;, with the belief that children so named are considered to belong to gods or Fate, and hence cannot be taken away from their parents by the god of death.
</p><p>Some people exchange their children for sweets, or offer them to others and purchase them back at a nominal price. Others roll them in the dust and name them Dhulio or dust. This is believed to ensure a long life to the children.<note id="n136.8" n="8">Mr. M. M. R&#257;na, Barton Female Training College, R&#257;jkot.</note>
</p><p>In some places, a relative of the child&#8217;s on the mother&#8217;s side presents it with a necklace of gold beads shaped like large black ants. When the child attains the age of eight or ten years this necklace is offered to some god or goddess.

</p><p>It is said that in ancient times change of sex could be effected.
</p><p>Tradition relates that all the children of a certain Solanki king died in infancy, except the last child, a girl. She was dressed in male attire and passed for a boy. When the pretended boy attained marriageable age, he was betrothed to a princess. When the day fixed for the marriage drew near, the king became anxious and went on an hunting expedition to pass the time. On his way back from the hunt he became very thirsty, and quenched his thirst with the water of a pond near which a temple of Bahuchar&#257;ji stands to this day. His bitch, which was with him, leapt into the pond, and on coming out of the water was found to be transformed into a dog. On seeing this the king brought his daughter and bathed her into the pond with the result that she was transformed into a boy. The king then built a big tank on the spot, which is known by the name of <hi>M&#257;n</hi>.<note id="n138.7" n="7">The School Master of Zinzuv&#257;da.</note>
</p><p>In a chapter called <hi>Brahmottar Khand</hi> of the <hi>Padma Pur&#257;n</hi>, which describes the glory of a vow called <hi>Uma Mahesh</hi>, the greatness of observing fasts on Mondays is described at length. Two Br&#257;hman brothers, one dressed as a man and the other as a woman, set out on a journey. Once they halted in a temple of the god Shiva, where lived a woman who had observed the fasts on Mondays. She invited them to dinner, taking them, as they appeared to be, for a man and a woman. The devotion of the hostess was so great that the brother dressed as a woman was actually transformed into a woman while partaking of the meal served to him.<note id="n138.8" n="8">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>It is related that in ancient times the son of a certain sage once disguised himself as a girl with the result that he was actually changed into a girl. He was thereafter called Mudr&#257;lopi and married to the sage Agastya.<note id="n138.9" n="9">The School Master of Uptela.</note>
</p><p>The warrior Shikhandi who assisted the P&#257;ndavas in killing Bhishma (who had vowed not to raise his arms against a woman) was at first a girl, and was subsequently transformed into a boy by the boon of the gods.<note id="n138.10" n="10">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>There is supposed to be a forest of P&#257;rvati in a continent called Ilavrit. Any man visiting it is at once turned into a woman.<note id="n138.11" n="11">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>A king named Sudyaman visited this forest and was transformed into a woman. It was only after appeasing P&#257;rvati by a sacrifice that he was restored to his original form.<note id="n138.12" n="12">The School Master of Bh&#257;y&#257;vadar.</note>
</p><p>It is believed that in Kamaru Desha or the land of fairies, children are transformed into the opposite sex by the spell of the inhabitants.<note id="n138.13" n="13">The School Master of Jetpur.</note>
<pb n="139"/></p><p>A belief is current that change of sex can be effected by the performance of the <hi>Shatchandi</hi> or the <hi>prayoga</hi> of Rudra, Bahuchar&#257;ji, &#256;sh&#257;puri and Mah&#257;k&#257;li.<note id="n139.1" n="1">The School Master of Kotda Sangani.</note>
</p><p>It is also believed that change of sex can also be effected by the spell of magic.<note id="n139.2" n="2">The School Master of Mota Devalia.</note>
</p><p>There is a further belief that <hi>Yogis</hi> by their incantations, and <hi>Mah&#257;tm&#257;s</hi> by their blessings or curses, can effect a change of sex.<note id="n139.3" n="3">The D. E. Inspector, H&#257;l&#257;r.</note>
</p><p>The following things are considered efficacious in protecting oneself against evil spirits:&#8212;

</p><p>Amulets are generally used as a precaution against the attack of evil spirits or the influence of an evil eye. They are also used to cure diseases. They are made of iron, copper, tin, gold, silver, alloys of precious metals, or leather.
</p><p><hi>Chithis</hi> or pieces of paper on which mystic signs are drawn are put into the amulets and are tied to the forearm with black woollen or silk thread.<note id="n139.9" n="9">The School Master of Kotda Sangani.</note>
</p><p>In some places, frankincense of <hi>gugal</hi> (<foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">Canarium strictum</foreign>) or <hi>lob&#257;n</hi> (<foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">olibanum</foreign>) is offered to the amulets before they are worn.<note id="n139.10" n="10">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>Amulets are also made of <hi>t&#257;d-patras</hi> (palm-leaves). They are tied round the arm with an indigo-coloured cloth.<note id="n139.11" n="11">The School Master of Gohilw&#257;d.</note>
</p><p><hi>Dor&#257;s</hi> or threads are also worn with the same object as amulets. They are generally made of five kinds of silk thread, black wool, or red or black cotton thread. The length of the <hi>dora</hi> must be eight feet, one and a quarter of a cubit or a man&#8217;s height. They must have three folds and must be twisted seven or twenty-one times. After they are twisted, they are knotted seven, fourteen or twenty-one times, when they become ready for use. An offering of frankincense made of <hi>gugal</hi> or of <hi>lob&#257;n</hi> is made to a <hi>dora</hi> before it is worn.<note id="n139.12" n="12">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>It is believed by some people, that a <hi>chiti</hi> (amulet) or <hi>dora</hi> in order to be effective, must not be touched with water.
</p><p>The <hi>dora</hi> of the god <corr sic="K&#257;lbhairav">K&#257;l-bhairav</corr> at Benares, which is made of silk thread with seven twists, is tied round the wrist of a patient in the belief that it cures illness.
</p><p>A <hi>janjiro</hi> (black cotton thread with seven knots) of the god Hanum&#257;n is worn round the arm with the same belief.
</p><p><hi>Surakano</hi>, that is, twisted iron wire, consecrated by the worshipper of the goddess Machhu, is worn by the Bharv&#257;ds round the elbow or the wrist with the belief that it cures wind.
</p><p>Those people whose children do not live long put silver anklets round their left legs in the belief that by so doing their life is lengthened.<note id="n139.13" n="13">The School Master of Todia.</note>
<pb n="140"/></p><p>An amulet made of a piece of cloth is called <hi>dh&#257;ga</hi>.<note id="n140.1" n="1">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note> It is either a piece of cloth used by a holy man, a piece of cloth containing a mixture of red lead and oil offered to the god Hanum&#257;n,<note id="n140.2" n="2">The Pathashala Shastri, Jetpur.</note> or a piece of cloth in which are wrapped up the things put into an amulet.

</p><p>Amulets tied to the horns of pet animals such as cows, bullocks, horses, etc., are called <hi>d&#257;man&#257;s</hi>. Sometimes they are also suspended from the necks of these animals. They are made of the hides of sacred animals and are believed to protect the animals against the evil eye, evil spirits and magic.<note id="n140.4" n="4">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note>
</p><p>It is believed by some people that one can escape injury from an evil spirit by seating oneself in a circle or square drawn in and plastered with cowdung.<note id="n140.5" n="5">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>Others hold that the circle must be drawn with the point of a sword.<ref type="noteref" target="n140.5">[#5]</ref>
</p><p>Some maintain that the circle cannot be a protective unless it is drawn with enchanted water, milk or sesamum oil.
</p><p>There are others who are of opinion that the entry of evil spirits into the circle can be prevented only by calling upon God not to allow the evil spirits to enter it.<note id="n140.6" n="6">The School Master of Kotda Sangani.</note>
</p><p>When an evil spirit is expelled from the body of a person, it is buried underground, a circle of water is made round the spot and an iron nail is driven into the ground, in order that it may be imprisoned there.<note id="n140.7" n="7">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>If anybody step into such a circle, the evil spirit confined therein takes possession of him, and is thus freed.<note id="n140.8" n="8">The School Master of Todia.</note>
</p><p>To prevent this, evil spirits are generally confined in secluded spots.<note id="n140.9" n="9">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>As the circle drawn by the point of a sword is a protection against an evil spirit, those who go to the burning ground to propitiate or subjugate evil spirits, seat themselves in such circles while reciting <hi>mantras</hi>.<note id="n140.10" n="10">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>After entering the circle, some people recite the name of Hanum&#257;n, Chandi or Bhairav.<note id="n140.11" n="11">The School Master of Chok.</note>
</p><p>Some people, after seating themselves in the circle, make offerings to the evil spirits, while reciting <hi>mantras</hi>, to propitiate them more easily. The <hi>K&#257;li chaudas</hi> or the fourteenth day of the dark half of <hi>Ashvin</hi> is considered a suitable day for propitiating or subjugating evil spirits.<note id="n140.12" n="12">The School Master of Zinzuvada.</note>
</p><p>There are various superstitious beliefs entertained by people regarding omens.
</p><p>1. If when leaving the house on a visit or with some definite object in view, a deer crosses one&#8217;s path from right to left, it is considered a bad omen, while crossing from left to right is considered good. On returning home, this omen is read in the reverse way to that just stated.<note id="n140.13" n="13">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>2. When starting on a journey, the braying of an ass on the right is a good omen and on the left, evil.<note id="n140.14" n="14">The School Masters of Dadvi and Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>3. If on leaving the house, a man meets an unwidowed woman or a virgin with a jar filled with water on her head, it is an indication that the object of the expedition will be accomplished.<note id="n140.15" n="15">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>4. While starting on a good errand, if one breathes through the left nostril or comes across a person carrying a basket of eggs, it is a good omen.
</p><p>5. If at the time of leaving for a visit to another town or village, the position of the moon in the circle explaining the position of stars with reference to one&#8217;s birth-day stars, be in the rear or on the left of that position, it is a bad omen, but if it be in the front or on the right it is a good omen.
<pb n="141"/></p><p>The moon in front means fulfilment of the intended purpose, on the right, it confers happiness and prosperity, on the back it causes death, and on the left, loss of wealth.
</p><p>6. The warbling of the bird <hi>bhairav</hi> on the right while going out and on the left while returning is a good omen, but the opposite is bad.<note id="n141.1" n="1">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>7. A cat or a serpent crossing one&#8217;s path is ominous of evil; but if either passes on the right, it foretells good.<ref type="noteref" target="n141.1">[#1]</ref>
</p><p>8. A jackal howling in the evening prognosticates damage by fire to the town or village; its howling at midnight predicts robbery; while in the last part of the night it foretells good.
</p><p>9. <hi>K&#257;g-r&#257;shi&#257;s</hi> (expounders of the utterances of crows) know the good and bad indications of the croakings of crows.
</p><p>10. The wailing notes of the bird <hi>F&#257;vadi</hi> forebode evil.<ref type="noteref" target="n141.1">[#1]</ref>

</p><p>The <hi>Pipal</hi> is one of such trees. It is considered to be the incarnation of a Br&#257;hman, and to cut it is considered to be as great a sin as murdering a Br&#257;hman. It is believed that the family of one who cuts it becomes extinct.<note id="n150.1" n="1">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>Some people believe that the spirits of the deceased do not get water to drink in the next world.

</p><p>The <hi>Tulsi</hi> or sweet basil is considered to represent Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu. It is also related that Krishna wanted to kill the demon Jalandhar, but he could not be killed on account of the merit of the chastity of his wife Vrinda. Krishna, therefore, assumed the form of Jalandhar, violated the chastity of Vrinda, and was thus enabled to kill the demon. Krishna next expressed a desire to marry Vrinda, when she transformed herself into the <hi>Tulsi</hi> plant. It is considered an act of great religious merit to wed Krishna with the <hi>Tulsi</hi>, and this marriage is celebrated every year by all Hindus on the 11th day of the bright half of <hi>K&#257;rtik</hi> otherwise called <hi>Dev Div&#257;li</hi>.
</p><p>It is considered a great sin to uproot this plant, though no sin attaches to the plucking of its leaves during the day time.

After having completed their stay in the forest, the P&#257;ndavas remained unknown for one year in the city of Vir&#257;t. During this year they concealed their weapons on a <hi>Khijado</hi> tree. Before taking these weapons, they worshipped the tree. Next took place the great battle of Kurukshetra in which the P&#257;ndavas won a splendid victory.

</p><p>All Hindus worship the snake. The day especially devoted to its worship is the fifth day of the bright half of <hi>Shr&#257;van</hi>, which is called <hi>N&#257;g panchami</hi>. In some places <hi>N&#257;g panchami</hi> is observed on the 5th day of the dark half of <hi>Shr&#257;van</hi>. On this day an image of a snake is made of cowdung or earth, or its picture is drawn on the wall.
</p><p>The image is worshipped as a deity, and <hi>kulera</hi>, a mixture of wheat, oat or rice flour, clarified butter, and sugar or molasses is offered to it. After worship, the members of the household take their meal and eat <hi>kulera</hi>, cocoanuts and cucumbers. Only one meal is taken on this day by men and women.<note id="n152.16" n="16">The Schoolmistress, Barton Female Training College, Rajkot.</note>
<pb n="153"/></p><p>The <hi>N&#257;g panchmi</hi> is observed as a <hi>vrat</hi> or vow, generally by women. They do not take any meal on this day, but live only on <hi>kulera</hi>. On this day, her Highness the Mah&#257;r&#257;ni of Baroda, mounted on an elephant, goes in procession to the woods to worship an ant-hill. The pipers who accompany the procession blow their pipes, and allured by the sound, the snakes come out of their holes, when they are worshipped and fed with milk.<note id="n153.1" n="1">The School Master of Khir&#257;sara.</note>

</p><p>It is related that there were once divine snakes in the royal fort of Jodia. When a pair (male and female) of these snakes were found killed, the heinous act was atoned for by the bodies of the snakes being buried and a temple erected over the grave. The male snake of this pair is known as N&#257;g N&#257;th or the Lord of Snakes.
</p><p>According to others, N&#257;g N&#257;th was a big white snake with gray moustaches. He once waylaid a milkman of the royal household, forced him to put down the milkpot he was carrying, drank the milk and went away. This snake is believed to be divine.<note id="n153.4" n="4">The School Master of Jodia.</note>
<pb n="154"/></p><p>The god Shiva is supposed to wear a snake round his neck like a garland of flowers. So, in all temples of Shiva, an image of a snake is installed behind the idol of the god with his hood spread over the idol.<note id="n154.1" n="1">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>In ancient times dead snakes were buried and temples and altars were erected over their graves. An image of the dead snake was engraved on the altar.<note id="n154.2" n="2">The School Master of Jodia.</note>
</p><p>There is a shrine dedicated to Ch&#257;ndalia N&#257;g on the bank of the river Palavo on the road from Mota Devalia to Tramboda. It is visited by a sect of beggars called N&#257;g-magas. The N&#257;g-magas beg wealth of the snake god, and it is said, that he bestows it on them. They are never seen begging from any body else.<note id="n154.3" n="3">The School Master of Mota Devalia.</note>

In modern times, Sarm&#257;lio, Bhujo and Gadhio are believed to be as powerful as gods, and vows are observed in their honour.<note id="n154.4" n="4">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>Dhananjaya, Pushkar and V&#257;suki are also considered to be very powerful.<note id="n154.5" n="5">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>Takshak is believed to have drunk the nectar of immortality.<note id="n154.6" n="6">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>A tradition is current that god Vishnu sleeps on the Shesha N&#257;g in the Milky Ocean. This snake is believed to have a thousand mouths and to support the earth on its hood.<note id="n154.7" n="7">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>It is described in the <hi>Pur&#257;nas</hi> how King Parikshit was bitten by Takshak N&#257;g and King Nala by Karkotak N&#257;g. King Nala became deformed owing to the bite, but he could assume his original form by wearing a special dress, through the favour of Karkotak.
</p><p>V&#257;suki N&#257;g was wrapped round the M&#257;nd&#257;r mountain, which was used as a churning handle by the gods and demons to churn the ocean for the recovery of the fourteen jewels from the ocean<note id="n154.8" n="8">The School Mistress, Barton Female Training College, R&#257;jkot.</note>.
</p><p>It is a common belief that treasures buried underground are guarded by snakes.
</p><p>Generally a miser dying without an heir is supposed to be born as a snake after his death, to guard his hoarded money.
</p><p>It is believed by some people that on the establishment of a new dynasty of kings after a revolution, a snake makes its appearance to guard the accumulated wealth of the fallen dynasty.<note id="n154.9" n="9">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>It is also believed that a rich man dying with his mind fixed on his wealth is born as a snake, to guard the wealth.<note id="n154.10" n="10">The School Master of Kotda Sangani.</note>
</p><p>There is a further belief that one who collects money by foul means and does not spend it, is born as a snake in his next life to guard his buried treasure.<note id="n154.11" n="11">The School Master of Char&#257;dva.</note>
</p><p>There is still another belief that a man who buries his treasure in a secret place becomes a snake after death, to guard the treasure.<note id="n154.12" n="12">The School Master of Khir&#257;sara.</note>
</p><p>The beliefs mentioned above have given rise to the impression that places where big snakes are found are sure to have<corr> a</corr> treasure trove concealed in them.<note id="n154.13" n="13">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
</p><p>It is believed that the snake guarding the treasure of his previous life does not allow anybody to remove it, and bites any one who attempts to do so.<note id="n154.14" n="14">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>If in spite of this, a man succeeds in seizing the treasure by force or by the power of <hi>mantras</hi> or incantations, it is believed that he leaves no heirs to use it.<note id="n154.15" n="15">The School Master of Songadh.</note>
</p><p>A belief is also current that such guardian snakes allow those persons to take away the treasures guarded by them if they are destined to possess them.<note id="n154.16" n="16">The School Master of <corr sic="Sonka">Sanka</corr>.</note>
<pb n="155"/></p><p>To the south of Kolki there is a site of a deserted village. It is believed to contain a buried treasure which is guarded by a snake with white moustaches. This snake is seen roaming about the place.<note id="n155.1" n="1">The School Master of Kolki.</note>
</p><p>It is related that a Br&#257;hman once read in an old paper that there was a treasure buried under a <hi>Shami</hi> tree in Deola. He communicated the information to the Th&#257;kor of Dhrol who secured the treasure by excavating the place. The Br&#257;hman went to worship the spot, but was buried alive. The Th&#257;kor buried the treasure in his castle, but the Br&#257;hman, becoming a snake, guarded the treasure and allowed none to touch it. All attempts to dig it up were frustrated by attacks of bees and the appearance of a snake.
</p><p>A Kshatriya named Dev Karan, while the foundation of his house was being dug, found a treasure guarded by a snake. He killed the snake by pouring boiling oil over it and secured the treasure.
</p><p>A Kunbi of Malia, while digging a pit for storing corn, found a large vessel filled with costly coins guarded by a snake. He killed the snake and secured the vessel.<note id="n155.2" n="2">The School Master of Todia.</note>
</p><p>There are many practices in vogue to render the poisonous bite of a snake ineffective.
</p><p>If the man bitten by a snake be bold, he cuts off the bitten part.
</p><p>Some have the bitten part branded.
</p><p>Those who have no ulcer in the mouth suck the poison, and spit it out.
</p><p>The powder of the fruit of the <hi>Nol Vel</hi> is also administered with water.
</p><p>Sometimes emetics and purgative medicines are given.
</p><p>A mixture of pepper and clarified butter is also believed to be efficacious.<note id="n155.3" n="3">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>Other remedies for the cure of snake bite, are as follows:&#8212;
</p><p>The patient is made to wear a cotton thread in the name of Charm&#257;lia N&#257;g, Sharmalia N&#257;g, or Vasangi N&#257;g, and certain observances, as stated above, are promised to the snake deity.<note id="n155.4" n="4">The School Master of Kotda Sangani.</note>
</p><p>The ends of peacock feathers are pounded and smoked in a <hi>chilum</hi> (clay pipe) by the patient.<note id="n155.5" n="5">The School Mistress, Barton Female Training College, R&#257;jkot.</note>
</p><p>A <hi>moharo</hi> (stone found in the head of a snake supposed to be a cure for snake poison) is applied to the wound caused by the bite. It absorbs the poison, and on being dipped into milk, transfers the poison to the milk.
</p><p>Thus it can be used any number of times.<note id="n155.6" n="6">The D. E. Inspector, H&#257;l&#257;r.</note>
</p><p>There is a Gir&#257;sia in Lakhtar who is believed to cure patients suffering from snake poison. As soon as a person is bitten by a snake, one of the garments worn by him is taken to the Gir&#257;sia, who ties it into a knot and this cures the patient.<note id="n155.7" n="7">The School Master of Lil&#257;pur.</note>
</p><p>There is a <hi>B&#257;va</hi> in Rajp&#257;ra, a village near Anandpur. He and all the members of his family are reputed to be able to cure snake-bites. When a person is bitten by a snake, he or a friend goes to the <hi>B&#257;v&#257;&#8217;s</hi> house and informs him or any member of his family of the occurrence. The <hi>B&#257;va</hi> or the person who receives the intimation folds into a knot a garment of the informant, which he afterwards unfolds. As soon as this is done, the patient is in great pain, loses his senses, is seized with convulsions and tells why the snake bit him. Thereupon the relatives of the patient implore the pardon of the snake, which is granted on condition that the patient should give alms to the poor.<note id="n155.8" n="8">The School Master of Anandpur.</note>
<pb n="156"/></p><p>In some places, <hi>Bhagats</hi> or devotees of M&#257;t&#257;ji are invited to dinner along with a number of exorcists, who are generally Rab&#257;ris. After they have assembled at the house of the patient, they start out in a procession headed by one who holds in his hand a bunch of peacock feathers, to bathe in a river. On their way to and back from the river they sing songs in praise of the goddess to the accompaniment of drums and other musical instruments. After their return from the river, the whole party are treated to a feast, which is supposed to cure the patient of the effects of the snake-bite.<note id="n156.1" n="1">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>Some people believe that snakes, like evil spirits, can enter the bodies of human beings. Such persons, when possessed, are supposed to have the power of curing snake-bites.<note id="n156.2" n="2">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>Every village has an exorcist who is a specialist in curing the effects of snake-bites. When a person is bitten by a snake the exorcist is at once sent for. He gives the patient <hi>Nim</hi> leaves and pepper to chew, to determine the extent of the effect of the bite. Next he asks one of those present to bathe and bring water in an unused earthen jar. He then recites incantations, and sprinkles water from the jar over the body of the patient. If this does not counteract the effects of the poison, he throws red-hot pieces of charcoal at the patient, when the snake speaks through the patient and states that he bit the patient because he committed a certain offence, and that he will leave him if certain offerings are made. After he has ceased speaking, the patient begins to shake and to crawl about like a snake, and is then cured. If the man be doomed to death, the snake would say, &#8220;I have bitten him by the order of the god of death, and I will not leave him without taking his life.&#8221;<note id="n156.3" n="3">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>Sometimes the exorcist fans the patient with branches of the <hi>Nim</hi> tree, reciting <hi>mantras</hi>, and thereupon the patient becomes possessed by the snake and declares the cause of his offence.
</p><p>Some exorcists present a magic epistle or charm asking the snake that bit the patient to be present. The snake obeys the call, and appears before the exorcist. The latter then asks the snake to suck the poison from the wound of the patient, which is done by the snake, and the patient is then cured.<note id="n156.4" n="4">The <corr sic="Schaol">School</corr> Master of Chhatr&#257;sa.</note>
</p><p>In some places, the exorcist ties up the patient when the snake tells the cause of the bite. Next the exorcist calls on the snake to leave the body of the patient, who then begins to crawl about like a snake and is cured.
</p><p>On some occasions, the exorcist slaps the cheek of the person who calls him to attend the patient. It is said that the poison disappears as soon as the slap is given.<note id="n156.5" n="5">The D. E. Inspector, H&#257;l&#257;r.</note>
</p><p>Some exorcists take a stick having seven joints and break them one by one. As the stick is broken, the patient recovers, his recovery being complete when the seventh joint is broken.<note id="n156.6" n="6">The School Master of Songadh.</note>
</p><p>It is believed that the Dhedas are the oldest worshippers of <hi>N&#257;gs</hi> or snakes. When a person is bitten by a snake, he is seated near a Dheda, who prays the snake to leave the body of the patient. It is said that in some cases this method proves efficacious in curing the patient.<note id="n156.7" n="7">The School Master of S&#257;nka.</note>
</p><p>It is stated that exorcists who know the <hi>mantra</hi> (incantation) for the cure of snake-bites must lead a strictly moral life. If they touch a woman in child-bed or during her period the <hi>mantra</hi> loses its power. This can be regained through purification, bathing, and by reciting the <hi>mantra</hi> while inhaling the smoke of burning frankincense. Some <pb n="157"/>exorcists abstain from certain kinds of vegetables and sweets, e. g., the <hi>Mogri</hi> (Rat-tailed <corr sic="raddish">radish</corr>)<corr>,</corr> <hi>Julebi</hi> (a kind of sweet)<corr>,</corr> etc. They have also to abstain from articles of a colour like that of a snake.<note id="n157.1" n="1">The School Mistress, Barton Female Training College, R&#257;jkot<corr>.</corr></note>
</p><p>A belief prevails that there is a precious stone in the head of the snake. Such stones are called <hi>mohors</hi>. They are occasionally shown to the people by snake-charmers, who declare that it is very difficult to procure them.
</p><p>It is stated that on dark nights snakes take these <hi>mohors</hi> out of their head and place them on prominent spots in order to be able to move about in the dark by their light.<note id="n157.2" n="2">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>It is believed that snakes give these <hi>mohors</hi> to those who please them. If one tries to take a <hi>mohor</hi> by force, the snake swallows it and dissolves it into water.<note id="n157.3" n="3">The School Master of Chhatr&#257;sa.</note>
</p><p>As stated above, the <hi>mohor</hi> has the property of absorbing the poison from snake-bites.
</p><p>It is because a snake is believed to hold a precious stone in its head that it is called <hi>manidhar</hi>, that is, holder of a jewel.<note id="n157.4" n="4">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note>

</p><p>In ancient times, when a well was dug, a human sacrifice was made to it if it did not yield water, with the belief that this would bring water into the well. Now-a-days, instead of this sacrifice, blood from the fourth finger of a man is sprinkled over the spot.<note id="n161.3" n="3">The School Master of Devalia.</note>
</p><p>It is also related that in ancient times, when a king was crowned, a human sacrifice was offered.

</p><p>Sieves for flour and corn, brooms, <hi>sambelus</hi> or corn pounders, and ploughs are regarded as sacred.
</p><p>Sieves are considered sacred for the following reasons.
</p><p>1. Because articles of food such as flour, grain, etc., are sifted through them.<note id="n161.8" n="8">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>2. Because, on auspicious occasions, when women go to worship the potter&#8217;s wheel, the materials of worship are carried in a sieve.
</p><p>3. Because the fire used for igniting the sacrificial fuel is taken in a sieve, or is covered with a sieve while it is being carried to the sacrificial altar.<note id="n161.9" n="9">The School Master of Dadvi.</note>
</p><p>4. Because at the time of performing the ceremony when commencing to prepare sweets for a marriage, a sieve is worshipped.<note id="n161.10" n="10">The School Master of Aman.</note>
</p><p>5. Because, in some communities like the Bh&#257;ti&#257;s, the bride&#8217;s mother, when receiving the bridegroom in the marriage booth, carries in a dish a lamp covered with a sieve.<note id="n161.11" n="11">The School Master of Todia.</note>
</p><p>The flour collected by Br&#257;hmans by begging from door to door is supposed to be polluted. But it is considered purified when it is passed through a sieve.<note id="n161.12" n="12">The School Master of Lil&#257;pur.</note>
</p><p>The <hi>sambelu</hi> is considered so sacred that it is not touched with the foot. If a woman lie down during day time, she will not touch it either with her head or with her foot.
</p><p>One of the reasons why it is considered sacred is that it was used as a weapon by Baldev, the brother of the god Krishna.
</p><p>A <hi>sambelu</hi> is one of the articles, required for performing the reception ceremony on a bridegroom&#8217;s entering the marriage <hi>pandal</hi>.<note id="n161.13" n="13">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>It is believed that a fall of rain is expedited by placing a <hi>sambelu</hi> erect in a dish when there is a drought.<note id="n161.14" n="14">The School Master of Zinzuv&#257;da.</note>
</p><p>Among Shrigaud Br&#257;hmans, on the marriage day, one of the men of the bridegroom&#8217;s party wears a wreath made of a <hi>sambelu</hi>, a broom and other articles. Some special marks are also made on his forehead. Thus adorned, he <pb n="162"/>goes with the bridegroom&#8217;s procession and plays jokes with the parents of both the bride and bridegroom. His doing so is supposed to bless the bridal pair with a long life and a large family.<note id="n162.1" n="1">The School Master of Zinzuv&#257;da.</note>
</p><p>On the marriage day, after the ceremony of propitiating the nine planets has been performed in the bride&#8217;s house, in some castes three, and in others one <hi>sambelu</hi>, is kept near the spot where the planets are worshipped. Next, five unwidowed women of the family hold the <hi>sambelus</hi> and thrash them five or seven times on the floor repeating the words &#8220;On the chest of the ill-wisher of the host.&#8221; The <hi>sambelus</hi> are bound together by a thread.<note id="n162.2" n="2">The School Master of Todia.</note>
</p><p>If a woman has to take part in an auspicious ceremony on the fourth day of her monthly period, she is made to thresh one maund of rice with a <hi>sambelu</hi>. Her fourth day is then considered as the fifth<note id="n162.a" n="A">Among Hindus women in menses are considered impure for four days.</note> and she becomes eligible for taking part in the ceremony.<note id="n162.3" n="3">The School Master of Lil&#257;pur.</note>

</p><p>In some places, on the <hi>Balev</hi> day, a number of persons gather together near a pond, and each of them fills an earthen jar with the water of the pond. Next, one of the party is made to stand at a long distance from the others with a small plough in his hands. The others then run a race towards the latter. He who wins the race is presented with molasses and a cocoanut.<note id="n162.8" n="8">The School Master of Zinzuv&#257;da.</note>
</p><p>It is customary among Br&#257;hmans to perform the worship known as <hi>Balevi&#257;n</hi> after the performance of a thread ceremony.

In villages, this function is performed by the headman of the village. The party go in procession to a neighbouring village or a pond where an earthen image of Ganpati besmeared with red lead is installed on a red cloth two feet square. Near this image are installed the nine planets, represented by nine heaps of corn, on each of which is placed a betelnut. This is called the installation of <hi>Balevi&#257;n</hi>. A plough about two feet in length is kept standing near the <hi>Balevi&#257;n</hi> with its end buried in the ground. The prime minister or the village headman worships the plough, after which, four Kumbh&#257;rs or potters wash themselves, and holding four jars on their heads, run a race. Each of the Kumbh&#257;rs is named after one of the four months of the rainy season. He who wins the race is presented with the plough. The expenses of the ceremony are paid from the State treasury or the village fund.<note id="n162.9" n="9">The School Master of Todia.</note>

</p><p>In all places, an auspicious day for ploughing and sowing is fixed in consultation with an astrologer.

</p><p>A dish called <hi>kans&#257;r</hi> is prepared, and served to all members of the family at the morning meal. Their foreheads are marked with red powder, and a pice and betelnut are offered to the household gods.

</p><p>In order to secure a favourable rainfall, a grand festival is observed on an auspicious day. On this day all agricultural work is stopped and <hi>megh laddus</hi> (sweet balls called <hi>megh</hi> or cloud) are eaten by the people.<note id="n168.12" n="12">The School Master of Vanod.</note>

</p><p>For the protection of crops of gram, wheat and sugar-cane against injury by rats, a ceremony called <hi>D&#257;dh B&#257;ndhavi</hi> is performed, in which a thread over which incantations have been repeated by an exorcist is passed round the crop, and an image of Ganpati is installed and worshipped with offerings of sweet balls of wheat flour.<note id="n168.14" n="14">The School Master of Ganod.</note>
<pb n="169"/></p><p>In some places, the ceremony of <hi>D&#257;dh B&#257;ndhavi</hi> is performed somewhat differently. Instead of passing a thread round the field, the exorcist walks round the field repeating incantations, holding in his hand a pot containing fire, over which is placed a pan containing <hi>Gugal</hi>. This ceremony is generally performed for the protection of sugar-cane crops against the attacks of jackals.

</p><p>There are various legends current among the people regarding the origin of the <hi>Holi</hi> holiday. The chief versions are as follows:&#8212;
</p><p>1. In ancient times there lived a demoness named Dhunda who preyed upon children. Her misdeeds caused great misery to the people, who went to Vasishtha, the preceptor of R&#257;ma, and implored him to tell them of some remedy for the mischief wrought by the demoness. Vasishtha told them to light a pyre in honour of the goddess Holika, which he said, would consume the demoness. The people accordingly lighted a huge fire, into which the demoness was driven by boys who led her to the spot by abusing her and troubling her in many ways. She was reduced to ashes by the fire, and the people were saved.<note id="n169.8" n="8">The School Masters of Dh&#257;nk and Ganod.</note>
</p><p>2. A demon named Hirani&#257;ksha had a sister named Holika and a son named Prahl&#257;d. Hirani&#257;ksha bore great enmity to R&#257;ma, while Prahl&#257;d was his devotee. Hirani&#257;ksha did not like his son&#8217;s devotion to R&#257;ma, and told him several times to give it up, and even threatened to take his life. But Prahl&#257;d did not swerve an inch from the path of his devotion. At last, being desperate, Hirani&#257;ksha decided to kill him, and entrusted his sister with the mission. Holika raised a big pile of cow-dung cakes, set it on fire, and seated herself on the pile, taking Prahl&#257;d in her lap. But through the grace of R&#257;ma, Prahl&#257;d escaped uninjured while Holika was reduced to ashes.
</p><p>3. A demoness called Dhunda had obtained a boon from Shiva to the effect that she would not meet her death during any of the three seasons of the year, either by day or by night. At the same time she was warned to beware of injury from children between sunset and nightfall at the commencement of a new season. To prevent any possibility of injury from children, she began to destroy them by preying upon their bodies. This caused a great panic among the people, who went to Vasishtha and asked his advice as to how to kill the demoness. He advised them to kill her in the way <pb n="170"/>described in legend No. I above, and she was killed accordingly.<note id="n170.1" n="1">The School Mistress, Barton Female Training College, R&#257;jkot.</note>
</p><p>4. The Govardhan mountain had two sisters named Holi and Div&#257;li. Holi was a woman of bad conduct while Div&#257;li&#8217;s character was good. Although unchaste, Holi boasted that she was chaste, and once, to prove her chastity, she threw herself on to a big fire. She could not bear the pain caused by the flames, and began to scream aloud, when people beat drums, abused her, and raised such a din that her screams became inaudible. Hence the custom of using abusive language and reciting abusive verses during the <hi>Holi</hi> holidays. Govardhan could not bear the disgrace attached to his sister&#8217;s reputation. So he threw himself into the fire and met his death without uttering a word of pain. This has given rise to the custom of throwing into the <hi>Holi</hi> fire the cow-dung image of Govardhan, which is installed during the <hi>Div&#257;li</hi> holidays.<note id="n170.2" n="2">Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i.</note>
</p><p>On the <hi>Holi</hi> day sweet dishes are prepared and taken with the morning meal. Some women observe a vow on this day, and dine once only in the evening, after worshipping the <hi>Holi</hi> fire with an offering of a cocoanut and walking seven times round it.<note id="n170.3" n="3">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>In some places, on the day preceding the <hi>Holi</hi>, which is known as <hi>Kamala Holi</hi>, sweet stuffed cakes are prepared, and on the <hi>Holi Punema</hi> day vermicelli is eaten.<note id="n170.4" n="4">The School Master of Moti Khiroli.</note>
</p><p>The fuel for the <hi>Holi</hi> fire is generally collected by boys. At about two in the afternoon on the <hi>Holi</hi> day a party of boys goes from house to house and receive five to fifteen cow-dung cakes from each household. These cow-dung cakes are bored, and strung on strings.<note id="n170.5" n="5">The School Masters of Dh&#257;nk and Songadh.</note>
</p><p>The fuel thus collected is heaped at the village boundary or the end of the street. All the male residents of the village or street meet at the spot, a pit is dug, and earthen pots filled with wheat, gram and water mixed together are placed in the pit and covered with cow-dung cakes. Next, the headman of the village or the leading resident of the street worships the pile with the assistance of a Br&#257;hman priest. After worship, the pile is lighted, at the time fixed by an astrologer,<note id="n170.a" n="A">This is generally in the evening or an hour or two after nightfall.</note> by a low caste Hindu, generally a Bhangi or Kotw&#257;l, as Hindus of good caste consider it a sin to kindle the <hi>Holi</hi> fuel. The Bhangi or Kotw&#257;l receives a few dates and cocoanut kernel for this service.<note id="n170.6" n="6">The School Masters of Zinzuv&#257;da and Moti Marad.</note>
</p><p>The offerings thrown into the <hi>Holi</hi> fire generally consist of fried <hi>juv&#257;ri</hi> grain, fried gram and cocoanuts. Flowers of mango trees and tender mango fruits are also thrown into the <hi>Holi</hi> fire. It is believed that newly married pairs, by worshipping the <hi>Holi</hi> fire, are blessed with long life, prosperity, and the birth of children. After the principal ceremony is over, they worship it one by one with the ends of their upper garments tied in a knot, and walk seven times round the fire with their hands folded, the husband leading the wife.<note id="n170.7" n="7">The School Masters of Dh&#257;nk and Vanod.</note>
</p><p>Infants dressed in gay clothes and decked with garlands of dry dates and bits of cocoanut kernel are also taken to the <hi>Holi</hi> fire by their parents. The latter worship the <hi>Holi</hi> <corr sic="M&#257;ta">M&#257;t&#257;</corr> and walk four times round the fire, taking the children in their arms. Next they offer cocoanuts to the goddess, which are either thrown into the fire or <corr sic="d stributed">distributed</corr> among those present.<note id="n170.8" n="8">The School Master of Chhatr&#257;sa.</note>
</p><p>Women whose children die in infancy observe a vow of remaining standing on the <hi>Holi</hi> day. When the <hi>Holi</hi> is lighted they worship the fire, after which they may sit down and take their <pb n="171"/>meal. It is believed that the observance of this vow ensures long life to children.<note id="n171.1" n="1">The School Master of Todia.</note>
</p><p>Although the <hi>Holi</hi> itself falls on the full-moon day of <hi>F&#257;lgun</hi> the rejoicings connected with it commence from the first day of that month. The principal feature of the rejoicings consists in indulging in indecent and vulgar songs and language. Vulgar songs or <hi>f&#257;gs</hi> in honour of the goddess Holi are also sung. Songs are composed abusing each caste, and sung addressing passers by, by groups of boys who have full license during the <hi>Holi</hi> holidays to indulge in all sorts of pranks and abuses.
</p><p>Some make wooden blocks with engravings of vulgar and indecent words, dip them in coloured water, and press them on the clothes of passers by.
</p><p>Others make naked idols of mud, and place them on the tops of houses.<note id="n171.2" n="2">The School Master of Songadh.</note>
</p><p>The day following the <hi>Holi</hi> is known as <hi>Dhul P&#257;davo</hi> or <hi>Dhuleti</hi>. On this day people indulge in the throwing of cow-dung, black pigments, urine, mud, coloured water and red powder.<ref type="noteref" target="n171.2">[#2]</ref>
</p><p>In some places, on the <hi>Dhuleti</hi> day, a game is played with a cocoanut. The players form themselves into two parties and stand opposite to one another. Midway between them is placed a cocoanut. Each party tries to take away the cocoanut, and prevents the other from so doing by throwing stones and cow-dung cakes. The party which succeeds in taking away the cocoanut wins the game.<note id="n171.3" n="3">The School Master of Kolki.</note>
</p><p>Amongst Dheds, Kolis, R&#257;vals and other low castes a post of the wood of the tamarind tree is planted in the ground and surrounded by women holding whips and cords in their hands. A party of men run to the women to drive them away and take possession of the post. The women prevent them from doing so by striking them with all their might with the whips and cords in their hands. This struggle commences at 10 <hi rend="sc">A. M.</hi> on the <hi>Dhuleti</hi> day and continues till one o&#8217;clock in the morning on the following day. At last the men succeed in carrying away the post, thus ending the game.<note id="n171.4" n="4">The School Masters of Zinzuv&#257;da and Todia.</note>
</p><p>In some places, a man is tied to a bier as if he were a corpse, and carried on the shoulders of four men to the post of tamarind wood, followed by a party of men and women wailing aloud, to the great merriment of the crowd assembled near the post to witness the struggle described above.<note id="n171.5" n="5">The School Master of Todia.</note>
</p><p>Sometimes contests are held between two parties of boys in singing vulgar songs. The contest commences by one of the parties singing a song. The other party responds to it by singing another song, which is generally more indecent than the song sung first. The contest goes on like this, and the party which fails to respond to its rival is said to be defeated.<ref type="noteref" target="n171.5">[#5]</ref>
</p><p>The immoral practices described above are only to be seen among low caste people, and even their women take part in these practices.
</p><p>The women of higher castes wear rich clothes and ornaments on the <hi>Dhuleti</hi> day, and sing songs in their houses. At times they throw coloured water and red powder at each other.<note id="n171.6" n="6">The School Mistress, Barton Female Training College, R&#257;jkot.</note>
</p><p>In big temples a festivity called <hi>Ful Dol</hi> is observed, in which water coloured with the flowers of the <hi>Kh&#257;khra</hi> (<foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">Butea frondosa</foreign>) is thrown by the party assembled, and <hi>kundali&#257;s</hi> or indecent songs are sung in a loud voice.<note id="n171.7" n="7">The School Master of Luvaria.</note>
</p><p>In some temples, holy songs are sung at night and prayers are held. At the end, fried <hi>juv&#257;ri</hi>, gram and sweets are distributed as the grace of God.<note id="n171.8" n="8">The School Master of Todia.</note>
</p><p>The boys who take an active part in the <hi>Holi</hi> celebrations are known as <hi>geraiy&#257;s</hi> or <hi>holi&#257;s</hi>. For two or three nights before the <hi>Holi</hi> they steal fuel for the <hi>Holi</hi> fire and beat and abuse <pb n="172"/>those who try to prevent them from so doing. They also recite coarse songs and play with dirt and mud freely. Parties of them go from shop to shop and obtain by force dates and fried gram.<note id="n172.1" n="1">The School Master of P&#257;tan V&#257;v.</note>
</p><p>At midnight of the <hi>Holi</hi> day a bower is erected in the centre of the village with bits of broken earthen vessels and cocoanut shells. A fool, generally a son-in-law of some low caste Hindu in the village, is induced, by the promise of dates and cocoanut kernel, to dress in a coat on which are drawn naked pictures. A garland of worn out shoes is tied round his neck and he is mounted on a donkey. He is then called <hi>V&#257;lam</hi> and taken from the bower through the village accompanied with music and crowds of people, who utter in a loud voice coarse and vulgar expressions as the procession moves on. At times they play jokes with the <hi>V&#257;lam</hi>, and give him blows on the head with their fists.<note id="n172.2" n="2">The School Masters of Ganod, Vanod and Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>In some places, this procession is called <hi>V&#257;lama V&#257;lami</hi> and is celebrated on the night preceding the <hi>Holi</hi>. Two poor stupid persons are dressed as bride and bridegroom, the latter in a ridiculously grotesque dress. They are married on the following morning, when vulgar songs are sung. The <hi>V&#257;lam</hi> and <hi>V&#257;lami</hi> are represented by two naked idols, made of rags, of a man and a woman. They are carried through the village in a noisy procession and married on an altar of black earthen vessels. They are then placed erect on two wooden posts side be side.<note id="n172.3" n="3">The School Master of Kolki.</note>
</p><p>In some villages, a large stone is placed in a spacious compound in the centre of the village, and broken earthen vessels are suspended over it with cords from the wooden bower erected over the stone. An ass is brought to the spot, and a fool decked with a garland of worn out shoes is mounted on it with his face turned towards the tail of the ass. He holds the tail of the ass in his hands as reins and is carried in procession through the village to be brought back to the bower and married to another fool, dust, ashes and water being freely used in the service.<note id="n172.4" n="4">The School Mistress, Barton Female Training College, R&#257;jkot.</note>
</p><p>In some localities naked images of a husband and wife are set in a cart and taken through the village accompanied with music, the crowd singing indecent songs all the way long.<note id="n172.5" n="5">The School Master of Todia.</note>
</p><p>On the <hi>Holi</hi> holiday children are presented with <hi>harda</hi> (garlands of balls made of sugar) by their relatives and the friends of their families.<note id="n172.6" n="6">The School Master of Songadh and Mr. K. D. Des&#257;i<corr>.</corr></note>
</p><p>The <hi>Holi</hi> fire is extinguished by women on the morning of the following day. The earthen vessels containing wheat and gram which are put into the pit of the <hi>Holi</hi> before the fire is lighted are then taken out. The grain is cooked by the fire of <hi>Holi</hi>, and is called <hi>Ghugari</hi>. It is distributed among the villagers, the belief being that those who eat it are protected against disease by the goddess of the <hi>Holi</hi>.<note id="n172.7" n="7">The School Master of P&#257;tan V&#257;v.</note>
</p><p>There are many other superstitious beliefs held by people in connection with the <hi>Holi</hi>.
</p><p>According to one belief, those who expose themselves to the heat of the <hi>Holi</hi> fire keep good health during the ensuing year. According to some, this can be secured by eating sugar-cane heated over the fire. <hi>Juv&#257;ri</hi> stems heated over the fire are given to cattle with the same object.<note id="n172.8" n="8">The School Master of Songadh.</note>
</p><p>Some believe that if salt heated over the <hi>Holi</hi> fire is given to cattle it protects them against epidemics.<ref type="noteref" target="n172.8">[#8]</ref>
</p><p>Virgins take home a little of the <hi>Holi</hi> fire and light five cow-dung cakes with it in the <pb n="173"/>courtyard of their house. When the cakes are burnt, the ashes are removed and the spot is purified with a plaster of cow-dung. Next, they draw some auspicious figures on the spot and worship them for a number of days in the belief that this ensures good health to their brothers.<note id="n173.1" n="1">The School Master of Khir&#257;sara.</note>
</p><p>Among Gujar&#257;t Hindus no special ceremonies are performed when a girl attains puberty, except that on the third or fifth day she is bathed by an unwidowed woman and dressed in green or saffron-coloured robes. She is given rice in milk, sweetened with sugar, and is presented with a piece of green satin.<note id="n173.2" n="2">The School Master of Dh&#257;nk.</note>
</p><p>In some places, the girl is bathed on the fourth day and given <hi>kans&#257;r</hi> to eat. She then bows to her mother-in-law and makes her a present of half a rupee. The mother-in-law blesses her and presents her with a bodice cloth.<note id="n173.3" n="3">The School Master of Vanod.</note>
</p><p>After the bath, a mark with red powder is made on her forehead and she is taken to the temple of the family deity.<note id="n173.4" n="4">The School Master of Dadvi<corr>.</corr></note>
</p><p>In some places, the red powder mark is made under the girl&#8217;s right arm in the belief that this ensures to her the birth of many children.<note id="n173.5" n="5">The School Master of Chok.</note>
</p><p>In some localities the girl is bathed on the third day, dainty dishes are served her, and she is presented with a cocoanut by each of her kinsfolk<corr>.</corr><note id="n173.6" n="6">The School Mistress of Barton Female Training College, R&#257;jkot.</note>
</p><p>In some castes, when a girl attains puberty, a feast of cooked rice and molasses is given to the caste people. In other castes, pieces of cocoanut kernel are distributed among children, and the girl is presented with a robe and bodice by her parents-in-law.<note id="n173.7" n="7">The School Master of Chhatr&#257;sa.</note>
</p><p>In some castes, a girl is not allowed to cook before she attains puberty.<note id="n173.8" n="8">The School Master of Uptela.</note>
</p><p>No ceremonies are performed when a boy attains puberty, probably because in the case of boys the change is not so marked as in the case of girls.
